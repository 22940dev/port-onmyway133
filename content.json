Here we use var objectWillChange = ObservableObjectPublisher() to notify state change, and because onReceive requires Publisher, we use let imagePublisher = PassthroughSubject&lt;UIImage, Never&gt;() Note that we use $ prefix from a variable to form Binding 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293import SwiftUIimport Combineclass ViewModel: ObservableObject &#123; var objectWillChange = ObservableObjectPublisher() let imagePublisher = PassthroughSubject&lt;UIImage, Never&gt;() var image: UIImage? &#123; didSet &#123; objectWillChange.send() if let image = image &#123; imagePublisher.send(image) &#125; &#125; &#125; var isDetecting: Bool = false &#123; didSet &#123; objectWillChange.send() &#125; &#125; var result: String? &#123; didSet &#123; objectWillChange.send() &#125; &#125;&#125;struct MainView: View &#123; @State private var showImagePicker: Bool = false @ObservedObject var viewModel: ViewModel = ViewModel() private let detector = Detector() var body: some View &#123; VStack &#123; makeImage() .styleFit() if viewModel.isDetecting &#123; ActivityIndicator( isAnimating: $viewModel.isDetecting, style: .large ) &#125; makeResult() Button(action: &#123; self.showImagePicker.toggle() &#125;, label: &#123; Text(\"Choose image\") &#125;) .sheet(isPresented: $showImagePicker, content: &#123; ImagePicker(image: self.$viewModel.image, isPresented: self.$showImagePicker) &#125;) &#125; .onReceive(viewModel.imagePublisher, perform: &#123; image in self.detect(image: image) &#125;) &#125; private func makeImage() -&gt; Image &#123; if let image = self.viewModel.image &#123; return Image(uiImage: image) &#125; else &#123; return Image(\"placeholder\") &#125; &#125; private func makeResult() -&gt; Text &#123; if let result = viewModel.result &#123; return Text(result) &#125; else &#123; return Text(\"\") &#125; &#125; private func detect(image: UIImage) &#123; viewModel.isDetecting = true try? detector.detect(image: image, completion: &#123; result in switch result &#123; case .success(let string): self.viewModel.result = string default: self.viewModel.result = \"\" &#125; self.viewModel.isDetecting = false &#125;) &#125;&#125; Read more https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/get-pro-with-react-setstate-in-10-minutes-d38251d1c781/ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56551131/what-does-the-dollar-sign-do-in-this-example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44037611/how-to-avoid-setstate-inside-render-when-state-depends-on-render?rq=1 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44037611/how-to-avoid-setstate-inside-render-when-state-depends-on-render?rq=1","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"swiftUI","slug":"swiftUI","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/swiftUI/"}]},{"title":"How to show loading indicator in SwiftUI","slug":"How-to-show-loading-indicator-in-SwiftUI","date":"2019-11-02T21:02:33.000Z","updated":"2019-11-02T21:02:39.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/How-to-show-loading-indicator-in-SwiftUI/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/How-to-show-loading-indicator-in-SwiftUI/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #486 1234567891011121314151617181920import SwiftUIstruct ActivityIndicator: UIViewRepresentable &#123; @Binding var isAnimating: Bool let style: UIActivityIndicatorView.Style func makeUIView(context: UIViewRepresentableContext&lt;ActivityIndicator&gt;) -&gt; UIActivityIndicatorView &#123; return UIActivityIndicatorView(style: style) &#125; func updateUIView(_ uiView: UIActivityIndicatorView, context: UIViewRepresentableContext&lt;ActivityIndicator&gt;) &#123; isAnimating ? uiView.startAnimating() : uiView.stopAnimating() &#125;&#125;struct ActivityIndicator_Previews: PreviewProvider &#123; static var previews: some View &#123; ActivityIndicator(isAnimating: .constant(true), style: .large) &#125;&#125;","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"swiftUI","slug":"swiftUI","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/swiftUI/"}]},{"title":"How to show image picker in SwiftUI","slug":"How-to-show-image-picker-in-SwiftUI","date":"2019-11-02T20:41:52.000Z","updated":"2019-11-02T20:41:52.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/How-to-show-image-picker-in-SwiftUI/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/How-to-show-image-picker-in-SwiftUI/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #485 The easiest way to show image picker in iOS is to use UIImagePickerController, and we can bridge that to SwiftUI via UIViewControllerRepresentable First attempt, use EnvironmentWe conform to UIViewControllerRepresentable and make a Coordinator, which is the recommended way to manage the bridging with UIViewController.

So ImagePicker can just accept a closure called onDone, and the component that uses it can do the dismissal. 12345678910Button(action: &#123; self.showImagePicker.toggle()&#125;, label: &#123; Text(\"Choose image\")&#125;).sheet(isPresented: $showImagePicker, content: &#123; ImagePicker(image: self.$image, onDone: &#123; self.presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss() &#125;)&#125;) Unfortunately, although the onDone gets called, the modal is not dismissed.

The format is equivalent to RFC 822 zone format (when optional seconds field is absent) About locale Formatting Data Using the Locale Settings Locales represent the formatting choices for a particular user, not the user’s preferred language. These are often the same but can be different. For example, a native English speaker who lives in Germany might select English as the language and Germany as the region About en_US_POSIX Technical Q&amp;A QA1480 NSDateFormatter and Internet Dates On the other hand, if you’re working with fixed-format dates, you should first set the locale of the date formatter to something appropriate for your fixed format. In most cases the best locale to choose is “en_US_POSIX”, a locale that’s specifically designed to yield US English results regardless of both user and system preferences. “en_US_POSIX” is also invariant in time (if the US, at some point in the future, changes the way it formats dates, “en_US” will change to reflect the new behaviour, but “en_US_POSIX” will not), and between machines (“en_US_POSIX” works the same on iOS as it does on OS X, and as it it does on other platforms). NSISO8601DateFormatter from iOS 10From iOS 10, we can use NSISO8601DateFormatter The NSISO8601DateFormatter class generates and parses string representations of dates following the ISO 8601 standard. Use this class to create ISO 8601 representations of dates and create dates from text strings in ISO 8601 format.

If your app previously registered for remote notifications, calling the registerForRemoteNotifications method again does not incur any additional overhead, and iOS returns the existing device token to your app delegate immediately. In addition, iOS calls your delegate method any time the device token changes, not just in response to your app registering or re-registeringThe user can change the notification settings for your app at any time using the Settings app. Because settings can change, always call the registerUserNotificationSettings: at launch time and use the application:didRegisterUserNotificationSettings: method to get the response. If the user disallows specific notification types, avoid using those types when configuring local and remote notifications for your app. didReceiveRemoteNotification About application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: Implement the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: method instead of this one whenever possible. If your delegate implements both methods, the app object calls the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: method.If the app is not running when a remote notification arrives, the method launches the app and provides the appropriate information in the launch options dictionary. The app does not call this method to handle that remote notification. Instead, your implementation of the application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions: or application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method needs to get the remote notification payload data and respond appropriately. About application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: This is for silent push notification with content-available Unlike the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: method, which is called only when your app is running in the foreground, the system calls this method when your app is running in the foreground or backgroundIn addition, if you enabled the remote notifications background mode, the system launches your app (or wakes it from the suspended state) and puts it in the background state when a push notification arrives. However, the system does not automatically launch your app if the user has force-quit it. In that situation, the user must relaunch your app or restart the device before the system attempts to launch your app automatically again.If the user opens your app from the system-displayed alert, the system may call this method again when your app is about to enter the foreground so that you can update your user interface and display information pertaining to the notification. How to handleUsually, the use of push notification is to display a specific article, a specific DetailViewControllerin your app. So the good practices are When the app is in foreground: Gently display some kind of alert view and ask the user whether he would like to go to that specific page or not When user is brought from background to foreground, or from terminated to foreground: Just navigate to that specific page. For example, if you use UINavigationController, you can set that specific page the top most ViewController, if you use UITabBarController, you can set that specific page the selected tab, something like that 1234567891011- func handlePushNotification(userInfo: NSDictionary) &#123; // Check applicationState if (applicationState == UIApplicationStateActive) &#123; // Application is running in foreground showAlertForPushNotification(userInfo) &#125; else if (applicationState == UIApplicationStateBackground || applicationState == UIApplicationStateInactive) &#123; // Application is brought from background or launched after terminated handlePushNotification(userInfo) &#125;&#125; Here we create another method handlePushNotification to handle push notification. When you receive push notification, 3 cases can occur Case 1: ForegroundLoud push No system alert application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called Silent push No system alert application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called Case 2: BackgroundLoud push System alert No method called Tap notification and application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called Tap on App Icon and nothing is called Silent push No system alert application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called. If app is suspended, its state changed to UIApplicationStateBackground Tap notification and application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called Tap on App Icon and nothing is called Case 3: TerminatedLoud push System alert No method called Tap notification and application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: with launchOptions, application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called Tap on App Icon and application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: is called with launchOptions set to nil Silent push No system alert application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called. If app was not killed by user, it is woke up and state changed to UIApplicationStateInactive. Tap notification and application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: with launchOptions, application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called Tap on App Icon and application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: is called with launchOptions set to nil System alertSystem alert only show if the payload contains alert 123456789101112&#123; \"aps\" : &#123; \"alert\" : &#123; \"title\" : \"Game Request\", \"body\" : \"Bob wants to play poker\", \"action-loc-key\" : \"PLAY\" &#125;, \"badge\" : 5 &#125;, \"param1\" : \"bar\", \"param2\" : [ \"bang\", \"whiz\" ]&#125; Silent push payloadFor now I see that silent push must contain sound for application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: to be called when app is in background 123456789&#123; “aps”: &#123; “content-available”: 1, “alert”: “hello” // include this if we want to show alert “sound”: “” // this does the trick &#125;, “param1”: 1, “param2”: “text”&#125; Read Pushing Background Updates to Your App If your app’s server-based content changes infrequently or at irregular intervals, you can use background notifications to notify your app when new content becomes available. A background notification is a remote notification that doesn’t display an alert, play a sound, or badge your app’s icon. It wakes your app in the background and gives it time to initiate downloads from your server and update its content. The system treats background notifications as low-priority: you can use them to refresh your app’s content, but the system doesn’t guarantee their delivery. In addition, the system may throttle the delivery of background notifications if the total number becomes excessive. The number of background notifications allowed by the system depends on current conditions, but don’t try to send more than two or three per hour.

They don’t appear as banners or show up on the lock screen. As you might have guessed, quiet notifications also don’t make a sound. If a user taps the “Keep” button, they can decide whether they want your app’s notifications to start getting delivered prominently (i.e. fully opt-in to push notifications) or continue to receive them quietly (i.e. pushes continue to get sent directly to the Notification Center). The intent of Provisional Authorization is to give users a trial run with your app’s notifications.

It can also be that user enables push notification but disables all sound or banner display mechanism. isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications is that your app has connected to APNS and get device token, this can be for silent push notificationcurrentUserNotificationSettings is for user permissions, without this, there is no alert, banner or sound push notification delivered to the appHere is the check 123456789static var isPushNotificationEnabled: Bool &#123; guard let settings = UIApplication.shared.currentUserNotificationSettings else &#123; return false &#125; return UIApplication.shared.isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications &amp;&amp; !settings.types.isEmpty&#125; For iOS 10, with the introduction of UserNotifications framework, instead of checking for currentUserNotificationSettings, you should use UserNotifications framework 12345678910center.getNotificationSettings(completionHandler: &#123; settings in switch settings.authorizationStatus &#123; case .authorized, .provisional: print(\"authorized\") case .denied: print(\"denied\") case .notDetermined: print(\"not determined, ask user for permission now\") &#125;&#125;) Push notification can be delivered to our apps in many ways, and we can ask for that 12UNUserNotificationCenter.current() .requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]) User can go to Settings app and turn off any of those at any time, so it’s best to check for that in the settings object 123456789101112131415open class UNNotificationSettings : NSObject, NSCopying, NSSecureCoding &#123; open var authorizationStatus: UNAuthorizationStatus &#123; get &#125; open var soundSetting: UNNotificationSetting &#123; get &#125; open var badgeSetting: UNNotificationSetting &#123; get &#125; open var alertSetting: UNNotificationSetting &#123; get &#125; open var notificationCenterSetting: UNNotificationSetting &#123; get &#125;&#125; Original answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/44407710/1418457","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"swift","slug":"swift","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/swift/"},{"name":"iOS","slug":"iOS","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/iOS/"}]},{"title":"How to use UserNotificationsUI in iOS","slug":"How-to-use-UserNotificationsUI-in-iOS","date":"2019-10-10T10:45:29.000Z","updated":"2019-10-10T10:46:19.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/How-to-use-UserNotificationsUI-in-iOS/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/How-to-use-UserNotificationsUI-in-iOS/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #454 From documentation https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotificationsui Customize how local and remote notifications appear on the user’s device by adding a notification content app extension to the bundle of your iOS app. Your extension manages a custom view controller, which you use to present the content from incoming notifications. When a notification arrives, the system displays your view controller in addition to, or in place of, the default system interface. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotificationsui/customizing_the_appearance_of_notifications When an iOS device receives a notification containing an alert, the system displays the contents of the alert in two stages. Initially, it displays an abbreviated banner with the title, subtitle, and two to four lines of body text from the notification. If the user presses the abbreviated banner, iOS displays the full notification interface, including any notification-related actions. The system provides the interface for the abbreviated banner, but you can customize the full interface using a notification content app extension.

What happens under the hood is that the custom token is sent to the Firebase Auth service in exchange for an ID token and refresh token pair which are used to keep the client SDK authenticated As with custom tokens, ID tokens are short-lived JWTs, lasting for just one hour. In order to allow end users to stay logged in for more than one hour, the modern SDKs transparently refresh a user’s ID token on your behalf using a refresh token If your app includes a custom backend server, ID tokens can and should be used to communicate securely with it. Instead of sending requests with a user’s raw uid which can be easily spoofed by a malicious client, send the user’s ID token which can be verified via a Firebase Admin SDK https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens#retrieve_id_tokens_on_clients When a user or device successfully signs in, Firebase creates a corresponding ID token that uniquely identifies them and grants them access to several resources, such as Firebase Realtime Database and Cloud Storage. You can re-use that ID token to identify the user or device on your custom backend server.

The workaround is to use manual layout and rasterization shouldRasterize When the value of this property is true, the layer is rendered as a bitmap in its local coordinate space and then composited to the destination with any other content. Shadow effects and any filters in the filters property are rasterized and included in the bitmap. However, the current opacity of the layer is not rasterized. If the rasterized bitmap requires scaling during compositing, the filters in the minificationFilter and magnificationFilter properties are applied as needed.

In regular rendering, the whole operation happens in special frame buffers that the display will directly read for rendering on the screen, repeating the process at a rate around 60 times per second. Of course the process have some drawbacks as well. The main one is that offscreen rendering requires a context switch (GPU has to change to a different memory area to perform the drawing) and then copying the resulting composited layer into the frame buffer. Every time any of the composited layers change, the cache needs to be redrawn again. This is why in many circumstances offscreen rendering is not a good idea, as it requires additional computation when need to be rerendered. Besides, the layer requires extra video memory which of course is limited, so use it with caution.

This function is not equivalent to deferreds.map { it.await() } which fails only when it sequentially gets to wait for the failing deferred, while this awaitAll fails immediately as soon as any of the deferreds fail.

If the Job of the current coroutine is cancelled or completed while this suspending function is waiting, this function immediately resumes with CancellationException.

All of these configuration changes cause the Activity to be torn down and recreated The ViewModel class is designed to hold and manage UI-related data in a life-cycle conscious way. This allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations. The ViewModel exists from when the you first request a ViewModel (usually in the onCreate the Activity) until the Activity is finished and destroyed. onCreate may be called several times during the life of an Activity, such as when the app is rotated, but the ViewModel survives throughout. Storing an Application context in a ViewModel is okay because an Application context is tied to the Application lifecycle. This is different from an Activity context, which is tied to the Activity lifecycle. In fact, if you need an Application context, you should extend AndroidViewModel which is simply a ViewModel that includes an Application reference. The first time the ViewModelProviders.of method is called by MainActivity, it creates a new ViewModel instance. When this method is called again, which happens whenever onCreate is called, it will return the pre-existing ViewModel associated with the specific Court-Counter MainActivity 1ViewModelProviders.of(&lt;THIS ARGUMENT&gt;).get(ScoreViewModel.class); This allows you to have an app that opens a lot of different instances of the same Activity or Fragment, but with different ViewModel information Dive deep into Android’s ViewModel — Android Architecture Componentshttps://android.jlelse.eu/dive-deep-into-androids-viewmodel-android-architecture-components-e0a7ded26f70 1234567891011121314151617181920212223/** * Utilities methods for &#123;@link ViewModelStore&#125; class. */public class ViewModelProviders &#123;/** * Creates a &#123;@link ViewModelProvider&#125;, which retains ViewModels while a scope of given Activity * is alive.

The HolderFragment has an inner static class named HolderFragmentManager. The HolderFragmentManager creates and manages HolderFragment instances.After creating the instances it associates them with an Activity or Fragment. The whole process is done using the methods holderFragmentFor(Activity) and holderFragmentFor(Fragment). How does HolderFragment retains the state ? By setting retain instance to true and not providing a view, the HolderFragment becomes essentially a headless Fragment that is retained for as long as the Activity is not destroyed. 123public HolderFragment() &#123; setRetainInstance(true);&#125; void setRetainInstance (boolean retain) Control whether a fragment instance is retained across Activity re-creation (such as from a configuration change). This can only be used with fragments not in the back stack. If set, the fragment lifecycle will be slightly different when an activity is recreated: Retrieving ViewModel instance1get(MyViewModel.class) It tries to retrieve a MyViewModel instance from the store. If none is there, it uses the factory to create it and then stores it into HashMap&lt;String, ViewModel&gt;.

For a detailed comparison on the automatic and manual confirmation flows, see accepting one-time payments. Step 3: Authenticate the payment if necessary Pass the confirmed Payment Intent client secret from the previous step to STPPaymentHandler handleNextActionForPayment.

Update UI components with NavigationUITie destinations to menu items NavigationUI also provides helpers for tying destinations to menu-driven UI components. NavigationUI contains a helper method, onNavDestinationSelected(), which takes a MenuItem along with the NavController that hosts the associated destination. If the id of the MenuItem matches the id of the destination, the NavController can then navigate to that destination. Add a navigation drawer The drawer icon is displayed on all top-level destinations that use a DrawerLayout. Top-level destinations are the root-level destinations of your app. They do not display an Up button in the app bar.

As predicted by many, Marzipan (now officially called Project Catalyst) a technology that could allow iOS apps to be ported to macOS, would be the main topic for this year. But WWDC went more spectacular than that, with dark mode on iOS, independent watchOS apps, and SwiftUI being the star of the show. With over 150 sessions and extra videos, it can be a bit overwhelming to catch up, so I sum up 10 essential sessions to get started. It’s good to catch up with the latest technology, but be aware that frameworks and APIs come and get deprecated very often. It’s better to understand why they are introduced, how to learn the skills and mindset so we can apply them in our apps to delight user experience. Firstly, a little tip to get the most of WWDC videos. Although you can watch on Apple developer website, there’s WWDC for macOS app that allows much more comfortable watching experience. There we can tweak playing speed, picture in picture view mode, favorite and download videos for offline watching. Secondly, for those of you who want to search some texts in the talks, there is ASCIIwwdc that provides full transcripts of all the talks. 1. Platform State of the UnionIf you only have time for 1 video, this is it. Right after the Keynote, Platform State of the Union is like keynote for developers as it highlights important development changes. macOS 10.15, iOS 13, watchOS 6 and tvOS 13: As usual we get version bumps on all major platforms, which brings lots of new features and enhancement. macOS 10.15 is caleld Catalina and there’s a whole new platform for iPad called iPadOS. Security and Privacy: Adding to security enhancement from last year, this year shows how Apple really commits into this. There are one-time location permission, signing with Apple, security protocol for HomeKit, new crypto framework which marks MD5 as insecure. Also, apps that target kids can’t display ad or include analytics. tvOS 13 gets multiple user support watchOS 6 makes way for independent watch apps, which does not require accompanying iOS apps. There’s also dedicated watch appstore. iOS 13 now can live in the dark, but dropping support for iPhone 5S, 6 and below. Also, there is ability to toggle language setting per app only. iPadOS is a spinoff version of iOS for now, they look the same but they are expected to take different paths. It includes mouse support and requires iPad Air 2 and newer devices. macOS 10.15 introduces a replacement of bash with zsh. It also supports SideCar which allows iPad as an external display. Last but not least, there is Project Catalyst that enables iPad apps to run on the mac. Xcode 11 includes Swift 5.1 that can target latest SDKs. It brings a new look and feel with tons of features like minimap, Xcode preview, official support for Swift Package Manager, source control enhancement and test plan. 2. What’s New in SwiftAlthough Swift is developed in the open, it’s easy to lose track of in tons of proposals and changes. Swift 5.1 brings lots of cool features that power SwiftUI and Combine, so it’s a prerequisite. Module stability: This looks unimportant but this may be the most key feature of Swift 5.1. Unlike ABI stability we get in Swift 5, module stability helps resolves differences at compile time. In other words, this ensures a Swift 5 library will work with the future Swift compilers. A single expression can be declared without return keyword Function builder, with marker @_functionBuilder which works pretty much like function with receiver in Kotlin, allows for some very neat DSL syntax. Property wrapper, a counterpart of Kotlin delegated property, allows property accessors to be used in a convenient way. Shipped with Swift 5.1, we can use that with @propertyWrapper annotation. Opaque return type with some keyword remedies limitation of Swift protocol with Self or associcated types requirements. Among other things, there are other cool features like universal Self, static subscripts, collection diffing and matching against optional. 3. Introducing SwiftUI: Building Your First AppWelcome to the spotlight of WWDC 2019, SwiftUI. It may be the most exciting announcement since Swift was introduced in 2014. SwiftUI is not just a new framework, it’s a complete paradigm shift from imperative programming with UIKit/AppKit to a declarative world. I was amazed by how quickly React and Flutter allows fast prototyping and developing, so I’m very happy Apple finally makes this available natively on all platforms. The cool thing about SwiftUI is that it is expressive and has consistent syntax across platforms. So it is a learn once, write anywhere concept. Together with hot reloading of Xcode Preview, this ends the long debate among iOS community about whether to write UI in code or Storyboard, as the source of truth is now the concise code, but users are free to change any UI details via interactive Preview. Not only SwiftUI handles consistent UI according to Apple design guideline, it also provides many features for free like accessibility, dark mode and other bookkeeping. SwiftUI supports latest platform versions and no backward compatibility, so some of us have to wait 1 or 2 more years until iOS 13 is widely adopted. To learn more about SwiftUI, there are other advanced sesions like SwiftUI Essentials Building Custom Views with SwiftUI Data Flow Through SwiftUI SwiftUI On All Devices Integrating SwiftUI 4. Implementing Dark Mode on iOSAs much as I was excited about Dark theme in Android Q, Dark Mode in iOS is something that eases my eyes. Some apps also support Dark theme by their owns, but with iOS 13, supporting Dark mode to our apps is not a daunting task. There are more vibrancy materials, system colors that adapts automatically to dark and light modes. We can also select images for each mode in Asset Catalog easily. 5. Introducing Combine and Advances in FoundationCombine is a unified declarative framework for processing values over time. As a huge fan of Rx, Combine looks like home. It was thrilled to see this finnaly get supported official by Apple. This simplifying asyncrhonous programming a lot, also streamline other communication patterns like KVO and notification center. Combine is the force the powers reactive nature in SwiftUI with Binding and BindableObject. There’s also lots of improvements to Foundation like collection diffing, new list and relative formatters, and notably Combine syntax for URLSession, which makes networking a breeze. To learn more about Combine, there’s Combine in Practice where we can learn more about error handling, schedule work and many operators on streams. 6. Modernizing Your UI for iOS 13Take a look at this talk to learn about new features in iOS 13 that we should be aware in our apps. Newly in iOS 13, we can take advantage of card style modal presentation that is very cumbersome to replicate ourselves. There’s also new UISearchBarTextField with advanced customizations for token and inputs. Lastly, the new UIMenu makes showing context menu trivial and make way for iPad apps to behave like native on the mac. 7. Modern Swift API DesignIf you’re developing iOS apps, chances are that you have already stumbled upon API Design Guidelines which contains valuable guides to structuring our Swift code. This highlights my most favorite programming advice “Clarity at the point of use”, because things we declare are written only once, but read many many times, so we should make those concise and clear. There’s also mention of preferring generic over protocol which reminds me of protocol witness technique. This talk details how Apple engineers themselves design Swift code in their RealityKit and SwiftUI frameworks. 8. Optimizing App LaunchThe launch time of your app can be decisive in user experience, it needs to be fast and do just the necessary things. With enhancements via shared and cached frameworks, apps now load faster on iOS 13. But there’s more thing we can do to improve this, thanks to the new App Launch profiler in Xcode 11, together with app launch time measurement in XCTests. The 3 words we can take away from this talk is minimize, prioritize, and optimize work at this critical launch time. 9. Introducing iPad Apps for MacStarting with iOS 13 with Project Catalyst, there’s a new target environment check called UIKitForMac, which allows iPad apps to target the mac while using the same code base. Most of the UI after porting have the correct look and feel like a native macOS app with many features provided for free like window management. There are, kind of obviously, some frameworks that are designed specifically for phone and tablet experience, can’t be supported in macOS. There are other sesions like Taking iPad Apps for Mac to the Next Level where we can learn more about this. 10. Creating Independent Watch Apps watchOS finally gets its own Appstore and the ability to run independent watchOS apps without a companying iOS app. With the introduction of URLSession and streaming APIs for the watch, together with enhancements in push notifications, Apple sign in, debugging, this can’t be a better time to start developing for the watch. It is stunning to see how Apple comes up with so many cool announcements this year while keeping innovation and quality high. There are more sessions to explore, head over to WWDC 2019 developer website to learn more.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"swift","slug":"swift","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/swift/"}]},{"title":"Support IP handover in rtpproxy for VoIP applications","slug":"Support-IP-handover-in-rtpproxy-for-VoIP-applications","date":"2019-06-12T19:33:28.000Z","updated":"2019-06-12T19:34:26.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/Support-IP-handover-in-rtpproxy-for-VoIP-applications/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/Support-IP-handover-in-rtpproxy-for-VoIP-applications/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #304 If you do VoIP applications, especially with open sources like pjsip, you may encounter kamalio and rtpproxy to serve SIP requests.

This refers to the scenario when user switches between different network, for example from Wifi to 4G and they get new IP. Normally this means ending in the SIP call, but the expectation is that we can retry and continue the call if possible for users. That’s why I forked rtpproxy and add IP handover support. You can check the GitHub repo at rtpproxy. Use src_cnt to track the number of consecutive packets from different address. When this number exceeds THRESHOLD (10 for RTP and 2 for RTCP), I switch to this new address This way Client can ALWAYS change IP when he switches from 3G to Wifi, or from this Wifi hotspot to another There’s no chance for attack, unless attacker sends &gt; 10 (RTP THRESHOLD) packets in 20ms (supposed my client sends packets every 20ms) This idea is borrowed from http://www.pjsip.org/pjmedia/docs/html/group__PJMEDIA__CONFIG.htm There is a macro PJMEDIA_RTP_NAT_PROBATION_CNT. Basically, it is “See if source address of RTP packet is different than the configured address, and switch RTP remote address to source packet address after several consecutive packets have been received.” Mobile clients now change IP frequently, from these hotspots to those. So if rtpproxy can support this feature, it would be nicer. Take a look at https://github.com/onmyway133/rtpproxy/blob/master/rtpp_session.h // IP Handover Count how many consecutive different packets are received, 0 is for callee, 1 is for caller unsigned int src_count[2];And how it actions in https://github.com/onmyway133/rtpproxy/blob/master/main.c static void rxmit_packets(struct cfg *cf, struct rtpp_session *sp, int ridx, double dtime) { int ndrain, i, port; struct rtp_packet *packet = NULL; /* Repeat since we may have several packets queued on the same socket */ for (ndrain = 0; ndrain &lt; 5; ndrain++) { if (packet != NULL) rtp_packet_free(packet); packet = rtp_recv(sp-&gt;fds[ridx]); if (packet == NULL) break; packet-&gt;laddr = sp-&gt;laddr[ridx]; packet-&gt;rport = sp-&gt;ports[ridx]; packet-&gt;rtime = dtime; i = 0; // IP Handover do not need canupdate // Use src_count if (sp-&gt;addr[ridx] != NULL) { /* Check that the packet is authentic, drop if it isn&apos;t */ if (sp-&gt;asymmetric[ridx] == 0) { /* if (memcmp(sp-&gt;addr[ridx], &amp;packet-&gt;raddr, packet-&gt;rlen) != 0) { if (sp-&gt;canupdate[ridx] == 0) { // // Continue, since there could be good packets in // queue. // continue; } // Signal that an address has to be updated rtpp_log_write(RTPP_LOG_ERR, cf-&gt;glog, &quot;IP Handover Set i 1st ridx %d&quot;,ridx); i = 1; } else if (sp-&gt;canupdate[ridx] != 0 &amp;&amp; sp-&gt;last_update[ridx] != 0 &amp;&amp; dtime - sp-&gt;last_update[ridx] &gt; UPDATE_WINDOW) { sp-&gt;canupdate[ridx] = 0; rtpp_log_write(RTPP_LOG_ERR, cf-&gt;glog, &quot;IP Handover Set canupdate to 0 1st ridx %d&quot;,ridx); } */ if (memcmp(sp-&gt;addr[ridx], &amp;packet-&gt;raddr, packet-&gt;rlen) == 0) { sp-&gt;src_count[ridx] = 0; } else { sp-&gt;src_count[ridx]++; // IP Handover RTCP packet sends at larger interval, so must use smaller THRESHOLD // Check to see if port is odd or even if(sp-&gt;ports[ridx] % 2 == 0) { if(sp-&gt;src_count[ridx] &gt;= 10) { i = 1; } } else { if(sp-&gt;src_count[ridx] &gt;= 2) { i = 1; } } } } else { /* * For asymmetric clients don&apos;t check * source port since it may be different. */ rtpp_log_write(RTPP_LOG_ERR, cf-&gt;glog, &quot;IP Handover We are in asymmetric ridx %d&quot;,ridx); if (!ishostseq(sp-&gt;addr[ridx], sstosa(&amp;packet-&gt;raddr))) /* * Continue, since there could be good packets in * queue. */ continue; } sp-&gt;pcount[ridx]++; } else { sp-&gt;pcount[ridx]++; sp-&gt;addr[ridx] = malloc(packet-&gt;rlen); if (sp-&gt;addr[ridx] == NULL) { sp-&gt;pcount[3]++; rtpp_log_write(RTPP_LOG_ERR, sp-&gt;log, &quot;can&apos;t allocate memory for remote address - &quot; &quot;removing session&quot;); remove_session(cf, GET_RTP(sp)); /* Break, sp is invalid now */ break; } /* Signal that an address have to be updated. */ rtpp_log_write(RTPP_LOG_ERR, cf-&gt;glog, &quot;IP Handover Set i 2nd ridx %d&quot;,ridx); i = 1; } /* * Update recorded address if it&apos;s necessary.

But with the help of those geeks on SO, the problems were demystified. Now it’s time to sum up and share with others :D What defines a unique connection ?There are 5 elements that identify a connection. They call them 5-tuple Protocol. This is often omitted as it is understood that we are talking about TCP, which leaves 4. Source IP address. Source port. Target P address. Target port. Does TCP listen on one port and talk on another port ?No. This is a common misconception. TCP listens on 1 port and talk on that same port. If clients make multiple TCP connection to server. It’s the client OS that must generate different random source ports, so that server can see them as unique connections What is the maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that a server can handle, in theory ?A single listening port can accept more than one connection simultaneously.There is a ‘64K’ limit that is often cited, but that is per client per server port, and needs clarifying. If a client has many connections to the same port on the same destination, then three of those fields will be the same — only source_port varies to differentiate the different connections. Ports are 16-bit numbers, therefore the maximum number of connections any given client can have to any given host port is 64K. However, multiple clients can each have up to 64K connections to some server’s port, and if the server has multiple ports or either is multi-homed then you can multiply that further So the real limit is file descriptors. Each individual socket connection is given a file descriptor, so the limit is really the number of file descriptors that the system has been configured to allow and resources to handle. The maximum limit is typically up over 300K, but is configurable e.g. with sysctl Concurrent connection request vs Concurrent open connectionWhen clients want to make TCP connection with server, this request will be queued in server ‘s backlog queue. This backlog queue size is small (about 5–10), and this size limits the number of concurrent connection requests. However, server quickly pick connection request from that queue and accept it. Connection request which is accepted are called open connection. The number of concurrent open connections is limited by server ‘s resources allocated for file descriptor. Why connection is rejected after successful TCP handshake ?It’s normal. When server receive connection request from client (by receiving SYN), it will then response with SYN, ACK, hence cause successful TCP handshake. But this request are stills in backlog queue. But, if the application process exceeds the limit of max file descriptors it can use, then when server calls accept, then it realizes that there are no file descriptors available to be the allocated for the socket and fails the accept call and the TCP connection sending a FIN to other side What are active and passive socket ?Sockets come in two primary flavors. An active socket is con­nect­ed to a remote active socket via an open data con­nec­tion… A passive socket is not con­nect­ed, but rather awaits an in­com­ing con­nec­tion, which will spawn a new active socket once a con­nec­tion is es­tab­lished Each port can have a single passive socket binded to it, await­ing in­com­ing con­nec­tions, and mul­ti­ple active sockets, each cor­re­spond­ing to an open con­nec­tion on the port. It’s as if the factory worker is waiting for new mes­sages to arrive (he rep­re­sents the passive socket), and when one message arrives from a new sender, he ini­ti­ates a cor­re­spon­dence (a con­nec­tion) with them by del­e­gat­ing someone else (an active socket) to ac­tu­al­ly read the packet and respond back to the sender if nec­es­sary. This permits the factory worker to be free to receive new packets Where to go from hereHere are some more links to help you explore further What is the difference between a port and a socket? Passive and active sockets Why will a TCP Server send a FIN immediately after accepting a connection? What is the theoretical maximum number of open TCP connections that a modern Linux box can have socket listen backlog parameter, how to determine this value?

This article is how I identify the problem and found a workaround for the issue, it may not be the solution, but at least the screen does not appear blank anymore. As someone who likes to keep up with tech via watching conference videos, I thought it might be a good idea to collect all of these to better search and explore later. So I built a web app with React and Firebase, it is a work in progress for now. Due to time constraints, I decided to go first with Wordpress to quickly play with the idea. So there is LearnTalks. The theme Marinate that I used didn’t want to render the search page correctly. So I head over to Chrome Dev Tool for Responsive Viewport Mode and Safari for Web Inspector The tests showed that the problem only happened on certain screen resolutions. This must be due to CSS @media query which display different layouts for different screen sizes. And somehow it didn’t work for some sizes. [@media](http://twitter.com/media) screen and (max-width: 800px) { #site-header { display: none; } }A bit about the rulesThe @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices. Media queries can be used to check many things, such as: width and height of the viewport width and height of the device orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?) resolution Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet (responsive web design) to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. So I go to Wordpress Dashboard -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Editor to examine CSS files. Unsurprisingly, there are a bunch of media queries [@media](http://twitter.com/media) (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 767px) { .main-navigation { padding: 0; } .site-header .pushmenu { margin-top:0px; } .social-networks li a { line-height:2.1em !Important; } .search { display: none !important; } .customer blockquote { padding: 10px; text-align: justify; } }The .search selector is suspicious display: none !important; The important directive is, well, quite important It means, essentially, what it says; that ‘this is important, ignore subsequent rules, and any usual specificity issues, apply this rule!’In normal use a rule defined in an external stylesheet is overruled by a style defined in the head of the document, which, in turn, is overruled by an in-line style within the element itself (assuming equal specificity of the selectors). Defining a rule with the !important ‘attribute’ (?) discards the normal concerns as regards the ‘later’ rule overriding the ‘earlier’ ones. Luckily, this theme allows the ability to Edit CSS , so I can override that to a block attribute to always show search page","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"tech","slug":"tech","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/tech/"}]},{"title":"Best places to learn iOS development","slug":"Best-places-to-learn-iOS-development","date":"2019-05-23T16:25:01.000Z","updated":"2019-09-12T07:11:34.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/Best-places-to-learn-iOS-development/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/Best-places-to-learn-iOS-development/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #278 Original post https://medium.com/fantageek/best-places-to-learn-ios-development-85ebebe890cf It’s good to be software engineers, when you get paid to do what you like best.

As someone who worked mostly with development, below are my indispensable apps. They are like suits to Tony Stark. Since I love open source apps, they have higher priority in the list. Open source appsiTerm 2 https://www.iterm2.com/ iTerm2 is a replacement for Terminal and the successor to iTerm. It works on Macs with macOS 10.10 or newer. iTerm2 brings the terminal into the modern age with features you never knew you always wanted. iTerm2 has good integration with tmux and supports Split Panes Term2 allows you to divide a tab into many rectangular “panes”, each of which is a different terminal session. The shortcuts cmd-d and cmd-shift-d divide an existing session vertically or horizontally, respectively. You can navigate among split panes with cmd-opt-arrow or cmd-[ and cmd-]. You can “maximize” the current pane — hiding all others in that tab — with cmd-shift-enter. Pressing the shortcut again restores the hidden panes. There’s the_silver_searcher with ag command to quickly search for files oh-my-zsh https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh A delightful community-driven (with 1,200+ contributors) framework for managing your zsh configuration. Includes 200+ optional plugins (rails, git, OSX, hub, capistrano, brew, ant, php, python, etc), over 140 themes to spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool so that makes it easy to keep up with the latest updates from the community. I use z shell with oh-my-zsh plugins. I also use zsh-autocompletions to have autocompletion like fish shell and z to track and quickly navigate to the most used directories. spectacle https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle Spectacle allows you to organize your windows without using a mouse. With spectable, I can organise windows easily with just Cmd+Option+F or Cmd+Option+Left insomnia https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia Insomnia is a cross-platform REST client, built on top of Electron. Regardless if you like electron.js apps or not. This is a great tool for testing REST requets Visual Studio Code https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode VS Code is a new type of tool that combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. Code provides comprehensive editing and debugging support, an extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools. This seems to be the most popular for front end development, and many other things. There’s bunch of extensions that make the experience to a new level. IconGenerator https://github.com/onmyway133/IconGeneratorBuilt by me. When developing iOS, Android and macOS applications, I need a quick way to generate icons in different sizes. You can simply drag the generated asset into Xcode and that’s it. vmd https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/vmd Preview markdown files in a separate window. Markdown is formatted exactly the same as on GitHub. colorpicker https://github.com/Toinane/colorpicker A mininal but complete colorpicker desktop app I used to use Sip but I often get the problem of losing focus. GifCapture https://github.com/onmyway133/GifCaptureI built this as a native macOS app to capture screen and save to gif file. It works like Licecap but open source. There’s also an open source tool called kap that is slick. Itsycal https://github.com/sfsam/Itsycal Itsycal is a tiny calendar for your Mac’s menu bar. The app is minimal and works very well. It can shows calendar for integrated accounts in the mac. PushNotifications https://github.com/onmyway133/PushNotificationsI often need to test push notification to iOS and Android apps. And I want to support both certificate and key p8 authentication for Apple Push Notification service, so I built this tool. Lyrics https://github.com/onmyway133/Lyrics A menu bar app to show the lyric of the playing Spotify song When I listen to some songs in Spotify, I want to see the lyrics too. The lyrics is fetched from https://genius.com/ and displayed in a wonderful UI. gitify https://github.com/manosim/gitify GitHub Notifications on your desktop. I use this to get real time notification for issues and pull requests for projects on GitHub. I hope there is support for Bitbucket soon. FinderGo https://github.com/onmyway133/FinderGoFinderGo is both a native macOS app and a Finder extension. It has toolbar button that opens terminal right within Finder in the current directory. You can configure it to open either Terminal, iTerm2 or Hyper Atom one dark themeThis is about theme. There is the very popular dracular themes, but I find it too strong for the eyes. I don’t use Atom, but I love its one dark UI. I used to maintain my own theme for Xcode called DarkSide but now I use xcode-one-dark for Xcode and Atom One Dark Theme for Visual Studio Code. I also use Fira Code font in Xcode, Visual Studio Code and Android Studio, which has beautiful ligatures. Chrome extensionsI use Chrome for its speed and wonderful support for extensions. The extensions I made are github-chat to enable chat within GitHub and github-extended to see more pinned repositories. There are also refined github, github-repo-size and octotree that are indispensable for me. caprine https://github.com/sindresorhus/caprine Caprine is an unofficial and privacy focused Facebook Messenger app with many useful features. Close source and commercial appsSublime Text https://www.sublimetext.com/ Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose. You’ll love the slick user interface, extraordinary features and amazing performance. Sublime Text is simply fast and the editing experience is very good. I’ve used Atom but it is too slow. Sublime Merge https://www.sublimemerge.com/ Meet a new Git client, from the makers of Sublime Text Sublime Merge never lets me down. The source control app is simply very quick. I used SourceTree in the past, but it is very slow and had problem with authentication to Bitbucket and GitHub, and it halts very often for React Native apps, which has lots of node modules committed. 1 Password https://1password.com/ 1Password remembers them all for you. Save your passwords and log in to sites with a single click. It’s that simple. Everyone need strong and unique passwords these day. This tool is indispensable Monosnap https://monosnap.com/welcome Make screenshots. Draw on it. Shoot video and share your files. It’s fast, easy and free. I haven’t found a good open source alternative, this is good in capturing screen or portion of the screen. VLC https://www.videolan.org/index.nb.htmliTunes or Quick Time has problem with some video codecs. This app VLC can play all kinds of video types. Xcode https://developer.apple.com/xcode/Xcode is the go to editor for iOS developer. The current version is Xcode 10. From Xcode 8, plugins are not supported. The way to go is Xcode extensions. I have developed XcodeColorSense2 to easily recognise hex colors, and XcodeWay to easily navigate to many places right from Xcode Sketch https://www.sketchapp.com/ Sketch is a design toolkit built to help you create your best work — from your earliest ideas, through to final artwork.

The ability to have pull requests get built, tested and release builds get distributed to testers allows team to verify automated build and identify problems quickly. I ‘ve been using BuddyBuild for both iOS and Android apps and were very happy with it. The experience from creating new apps and deploying build is awesome. It works so well that Apple acquired it, which then lead to the fact that Android apps are no longer supported and new customers can’t register. We are one of those who are looking for new alternatives. We’ve been using TravisCI, CircleCI and Jenkins to deploy to Fabric. There is also TeamCity that is promising. But after a quick survey with friends and people, Bitrise is the most recommended. So maybe I should try that. The thing I like about Bitrise is its wide range support of workflow. They are just scripts that execute certain actions, and most of them are open source. There’s also yml config file, but all things can be done using web interface, so I don’t need to look into pages of documentation just to get the configuration right. This post is not a promote for Bitrise, it is just about trying and adapting to new things. There is no eternal thing in tech, things come ad go fast. Below are some of the lessons I learn after using Bitrise, hope you find them useful. Variant to buildThere is no Android Build step in the default ‘primary’ workflow, as primary is generally used for testing the code for every push. There is an Android Build step in the deploy workflow and the app gets built by running this workflow. However, I like to have the Android Build step in my primary workflow, so I added it there. Usually I want app module and stagingRelease build variant as we need to deploy staging builds to internal testers. If you go to Bitrise.yml tab you can see that the configuration file has been updated. This is very handy. I’ve used some other CI services and I needed to lookup their documentation on how to make this yml work. Bump version code automaticallyI’ve used some other CI services before and the app version code surely does not start from 0. So it makes sense that Bitrise can auto bump version code from the current number. There are some predefined steps in Workflow but they don’t serve my need For the Set Android Manifest Version code and name step, the source code is here so I understand what it does. It works by modify AndroidManifest.xml file using sed . This article Adjust your build number is not clear enough. sed -i.bak “s/android:versionCode=”\\”${VERSIONCODE}\\””/android:versionCode=”\\”${CONFIG_new_version_code}\\””/” ${manifest_file}In our projects, the versionCode is from an environment variable BUILD_NUMBER in Jenkins, so we need look up the same thing in Available Environment Variables, and it is BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER , which is a build number of the build on bitrise.io. This is how versionCode looks like in build.gradle versionCode (System.*getenv*(&quot;BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER&quot;) as Integer ?: System.*getenv*(&quot;BUILD_NUMBER&quot;) as Integer ?: 243)243 is the current version code of this project, so let’s go to app’s Settings and change Your next build number will be Deploy to FabricI hope Bitrise has its own Crash reporting tool. For now I use Crashlytics in Fabric. And despite that Bitrise can distribute builds to testers, I still need to cross deploy to Fabric for historial reasons. There is only script steps-fabric-crashlytics-beta-deploy to deploy IPA file for iOS apps, so we need something for Android. Fortunately I can use the Fabric plugin for gradle. Add Fabric pluginFollow Install Crashlytics via Gradle to add Fabric plugin. Basically you need to add these dependencies to your app ‘s build.gradle buildscript { repositories { google() maven { url &apos;https://maven.fabric.io/public&apos; } } dependencies { classpath &apos;io.fabric.tools:gradle:1.+&apos; } } apply plugin: &apos;io.fabric&apos; dependencies { compile(&apos;com.crashlytics.sdk.android:crashlytics:2.9.4@aar&apos;) { transitive = true; } }and API credentials in Manifest file &lt;meta-data android:name=”io.fabric.ApiKey” android:value=”67ffdb78ce9cd50af8404c244fa25df01ea2b5bc” /&gt;Deploy commandModern Android Studio usually includes a gradlew execution file in the root of your project. Run ./gradlew tasks for the list of tasks that you app can perform, look for Build tasks that start with assemble . Read more Build your app from the command line You can execute all the build tasks available to your Android project using the Gradle wrapper command line tool. It’s available as a batch file for Windows (gradlew.bat) and a shell script for Linux and Mac (gradlew.sh), and it’s accessible from the root of each project you create with Android Studio. For me, I want to deploy staging release build variant, so I run. Check that the build is on Fabric. ./gradlew assembleStagingRelease crashlyticsUploadDistributionStagingReleaseManage tester groupGo to your app on Fabric.io and create group of testers. Note that alias that is generated for the group Go to your app’s build.gradle and add ext.betaDistributionGroupAliases=’my-internal-testers’ to your desired productFlavors or buildTypes . For me I add to staging under productFlavors productFlavors { staging { // … ext.betaDistributionGroupAliases=’hyper-internal-testers-1&apos; } production { // … } }Now that the command is run correctly, let’s add that to Bitrise Gradle Run stepGo to Workflow tab and add a Gradle Run step and place it below Deploy to Bitrise.io step. Expand Config, and add assembleStagingRelease crashlyticsUploadDistributionStagingRelease to Gradle task to run . Now start a new build in Bitrise manually or trigger new build by making pull request, you can see that the version code is increased for every build, crossed build gets deployed to Fabric to your defined tester groups. As an alternative, you can also use Fabric/Crashlytics deployer, just update config with your apps key and secret found in settings. Where to go from hereI hope those tips are useful to you.

It is a cross-platform layout engine which implements Flexbox so we use the same layout code for both platforms. As someone who uses Auto Layout in iOS and Constraint Layout in Android, I find Flexbox bit hard to use at first, but there are many tasks that Flexbox does very well, they are distribute elements in space and flow layout. In this post we will use Flexbox to build a tag selection view using just Javascript code. This is very easy to do so we don’t need to install extra dependencies. Our tag view will support both multiple selection and exclusive selection. First, we need a custom Button . Button with BackgroundButton is of the basic elements in React Native, but it is somewhat limited if we want to have custom content inside the button, for example texts, images and background import { Button } from &apos;react-native&apos; ... &lt;Button onPress={onPressLearnMore} title=&quot;Learn More&quot; color=&quot;#841584&quot; accessibilityLabel=&quot;Learn more about this purple button&quot; /&gt;TouchableOpacityLuckily we have TouchableOpacity, which is a wrapper for making views respond properly to touches. On press down, the opacity of the wrapped view is decreased, dimming it. To implement button in our tag view, we need to a button with background a check image. Create a file called BackgroundButton.js import React from &apos;react&apos; import { TouchableOpacity, View, Text, StyleSheet, Image } from &apos;react-native&apos; import R from &apos;res/R&apos; export default class BackgroundButton extends React.Component { render() { const styles = this.makeStyles() return ( &lt;TouchableOpacity style={styles.touchable} onPress={this.props.onPress}&gt; &lt;View style={styles.view}&gt; {this.makeImageIfAny(styles)} &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;{this.props.title}&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;/View&gt; &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt; ) } makeImageIfAny(styles) { if (this.props.showImage) { return &lt;Image style={styles.image} source={R.images.check} /&gt; } } makeStyles() { return StyleSheet.create({ view: { flexDirection: &apos;row&apos;, borderRadius: 23, borderColor: this.props.borderColor, borderWidth: 2, backgroundColor: this.props.backgroundColor, height: 46, alignItems: &apos;center&apos;, justifyContent: &apos;center&apos;, paddingLeft: 16, paddingRight: 16 }, touchable: { marginLeft: 4, marginRight: 4, marginBottom: 8 }, image: { marginRight: 8 }, text: { fontSize: 18, textAlign: &apos;center&apos;, color: this.props.textColor, fontSize: 16 } }) } }Dynamic stylesNormally we use const styles = StyleSheet.create({}) but since we want our button to be configurable, we make styles into a function, so on every render we get a new styles with proper configurations. The properties we support are borderColor, textColor, backgroundColor and showImage In the makeImageIfAny we only need to return Image if the view is selected. We don’t have the else case, so in if showImage is false, this returns undefined and React won’t render any element makeImageIfAny(styles) { if (this.props.showImage) { return &lt;Image style={styles.image} source={R.images.check} /&gt; } }padding and marginTo understand padding and margin, visit CSS Box Model. Basically padding means clearing an area around the content and padding is transparent, while margin means clearing an area outside the border and the margin also is transparent. Pay attention to styles . We have margin for touchable so that each tag button have a little margin outside each other. touchable: { marginLeft: 4, marginRight: 4, marginBottom: 8 }In the view we need flexDirection as row because React Native has flexDirection as column by default. And a row means we have Image and Text side by side horizontally inside the button. We also use alignItems and justifyContent to align elements centeredly on both main and cross axises. The padding is used to have some spaces between the inner text and the view. view: { flexDirection: &apos;row&apos;, height: 46, alignItems: &apos;center&apos;, justifyContent: &apos;center&apos;, paddingLeft: 16, paddingRight: 16 }Tag ViewCreate a file called TagsView.js This is where we parse tags and show a bunch of BackgroundButton import React from &apos;react&apos; import { View, StyleSheet, Button } from &apos;react-native&apos; import R from &apos;res/R&apos; import BackgroundButton from &apos;library/components/BackgroundButton&apos; import addOrRemove from &apos;library/utils/addOrRemove&apos; export default class TagsView extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) this.state = { selected: props.selected } } render() { return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; {this.makeButtons()} &lt;/View&gt; ) } onPress = (tag) =&gt; { let selected if (this.props.isExclusive) { selected = [tag] } else { selected = addOrRemove(this.state.selected, tag) } this.setState({ selected }) } makeButtons() { return this.props.all.map((tag, i) =&gt; { const on = this.state.selected.includes(tag) const backgroundColor = on ? R.colors.on.backgroundColor : R.colors.off.backgroundColor const textColor = on ? R.colors.on.text : R.colors.off.text const borderColor = on ? R.colors.on.border : R.colors.off.border return ( &lt;BackgroundButton backgroundColor={backgroundColor} textColor={textColor} borderColor={borderColor} onPress={() =&gt; { this.onPress(tag) }} key={i} showImage={on} title={tag} /&gt; ) }) } } const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, flexDirection: &apos;row&apos;, flexWrap: &apos;wrap&apos;, padding: 20 } })We parse an array of tags to build BackgroundButton . We keep the selected array in state because this is mutated inside the TagsView component. If it is isExclusive then the new selected contains just the new selected tag. If it is multiple selection, then we add the new selected tag into the selected array. The addOrRemove is a our homegrown utility function to add an item into an array if it does not exists, or remove if it exists, using the high orderfilter function. const addOrRemove = (array, item) =&gt; { const exists = array.includes(item) if (exists) { return array.filter((c) =&gt; { return c !== item }) } else { const result = array result.push(item) return result } }Flex wrapPay attention to styles const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, flexDirection: &apos;row&apos;, flexWrap: &apos;wrap&apos;, padding: 20 } })The hero here is flexWrap which specifies whether the flexible items should wrap or not. Take a look at CSS flex-wrap property for other options. Since we have main axis as row , element will be wrapped to the next row if there are not enough space. That’s how we can achieve a beautiful tag view. Using TagsViewThen consuming TagsView is as easy as declare it inside render const selected = [&apos;Swift&apos;, Kotlin] const tags = [&apos;Swift&apos;, &apos;Kotlin&apos;, &apos;C#&apos;, &apos;Haskell&apos;, &apos;Java&apos;] return ( &lt;TagsView all={tags} selected={selected} isExclusive={false} /&gt; )Learning FlexboxLearning Flebox is crucial in using React and React Native effectively.

I’m so glad to finally launch LearnTalks, in order to help others and myself to catch up with new conference and meetup talks. Being one who is extremely passionate about making things and writing , I also love to learn about every new thing in tech. Tech moves so fast, what we learn today may be deprecated very soon, and only continuous learning can keep us move forward. Tech conference and meetup are best places to learn about new things and tips, although there are some rises and falls …, they are still growing and provides valuable resources for lots of people. There are lots of conferences and meetups that one can’t go to all, this can give fear of missing out feeling. Fortunately people are kind enough to always publish videos publicly so others can learn from. I have been for a long time curating a list… to keep track of all cool videos, but it get out of hand very quickly. That’s why I make LearnTalks.com as a convenient place to search and explore new tech talks. The features include Easy search for talk, author and event See upcoming events Explore tags of topics and technologies Mobile friendly Firstly, thanks to all the people who helped me alpha test the website and provided valuable feedback. I addressed and fixed many issues.And thanks a lot to many conference organisers who gave me a yes, support and encouragement promptly after I sent emails. Thanks a lot for spending your free time organising cool events and sharing the videos to the community. I really appreciate.

And for each app that we build, there are times we need to reuse the same code, build and tweak it a bit to make it work for different environments. For example, we might need multiple skins, themes, a free and paid version, or more often different staging and production environments. And the task that we can’t avoid is adding app icons and splash screens to our apps. In fact, to add a staging and production environment, and to add app icons, requires us to use Xcode and Android Studio, and we do it the same way we do with native iOS or Android projects. Let’s call our app MyApp and bootstrap it with react-native init MyApp . There will of course, be tons of libraries to help us with managing different environments. In this post, we will do just like we did with native apps, so that we know the basic steps. Build configuration, target, build types, production flavor, and build variantThere are some terminologies we needed to remember. In iOS, debug and releases are called build configurations, and staging and production are called targets. A build configuration specifies a set of build settings used to build a target’s product in a particular way. For example, it is common to have separate build configurations for debug and release builds of a product.A target specifies a product to build and contains the instructions for building the product from a set of files in a project or work-space. A target defines a single product; it organizes the inputs into the build system — the source files and instructions for processing those source files — required to build that product. Projects can contain one or more targets, each of which produces one product In Android, debug and releases are called build types, and staging and production are called product flavors. Together they form build variants. For example, a “demo” product flavor can specify different features and device requirements, such as custom source code, resources, and minimum API levels, while the “debug” build type applies different build and packaging settings, such as debug options and signing keys. The resulting build variant is the “demoDebug” version of your app, and it includes a combination of the configurations and resources included in the “demo” product flavor, “debug” build type, and main/ source set. Staging and production targets in iOSOpen MyApp.xcodeproj inside ios using Xcode. Here is what we get after bootstrapping: React Native creates iOS and tvOS apps, and two test targets. In Xcode, a project can contain many targets, and each target means a unique product with its own build settings — Info.plist and app icons. Duplicate targetIf we don’t need the tvOS app, we can delete the MyApp-tvOS and MyApp-tvOSTests . Let’s use MyApp target as our production environment, and right click -&gt; Duplicate to make another target. Let’s call it MyApp Staging. Each target must have unique bundle id. Change the bundle id of MyApp to com.onmyway133.MyApp and MyApp Staging to com.onmyway133.MyApp.Staging. Info.plistWhen we duplicate MyApp target , Xcode also duplicates Info.plist into MyApp copy-Info.plist for the staging target. Change it to a more meaningful name Info-Staging.plist and drag it to the MyApp group in Xcode to stay organised. After dragging, MyApp Staging target can’t find the plist, so click Choose Info.plist File and point to the Info-Staging.plist. SchemeXcode also duplicates the scheme when we duplicate the target, so we get MyApp copy: Click Manage Schemes in the scheme drop-down to open Scheme manager: I usually delete the generated MyApp copy scheme, then I create a new scheme again for the MyApp Staging target. You need to make sure that the scheme is marked as Shared so that it is tracked into git. For some reason, the staging scheme does not have all the things set up like the production scheme. You can run into issues like ‘React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h’ file not found or RN: ‘React/RCTBridgeModule.h’ file not found . It is because React target is not linked yet. To solve it, we must disable Parallelise Build and add React target and move it above MyApp Staging. Staging and production product flavors in AndroidOpen the android folder in Android Studio. By default there are only debug and release build types: They are configured in the app module build.gradle: buildTypes { release { minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(&quot;proguard-android.txt&quot;), &quot;proguard-rules.pro&quot; } }First, let’s change application id to com.onmyway133.MyApp to match iOS. It is not required but I think it’s good to stay organised. Then create two product flavors for staging and production. For staging, let’s add .Staging to the application id. From Android Studio 3, “all flavors must now belong to a named flavor dimension” — normally we just need default dimensions. Here is how it looks in build.gradle for our app module: android { compileSdkVersion rootProject.ext.compileSdkVersion buildToolsVersion rootProject.ext.buildToolsVersion flavorDimensions &quot;default&quot; defaultConfig { applicationId &quot;com.onmyway133.MyApp&quot; minSdkVersion rootProject.ext.minSdkVersion targetSdkVersion rootProject.ext.targetSdkVersion versionCode 1 versionName &quot;1.0&quot; ndk { abiFilters &quot;armeabi-v7a&quot;, &quot;x86&quot; } } splits { abi { reset() enable enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture universalApk false // If true, also generate a universal APK include &quot;armeabi-v7a&quot;, &quot;x86&quot; } } buildTypes { release { minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(&quot;proguard-android.txt&quot;), &quot;proguard-rules.pro&quot; } } productFlavors { staging { applicationIdSuffix &quot;.Staging&quot; } production { } } }Click Sync Now to let gradle do the syncing job. After that, we can see that we have four build variants: How to run staging and productionTo run the Android app, we can specify a variant like react-native run-android — variant=productionDebug, but I prefer to go to Android Studio, select the variant, and run. To run iOS app, we can specify the scheme like react-native run-ios — simulator=’iPhone X’ — scheme=”MyApp Staging” . As of react-native 0.57.0 this does not work. But it does not matter as I usually go to Xcode, select the scheme, and run. Add app icon for iOSAccording to the Human Interface Guideline, we need app icons of different sizes for different iOS versions, device resolutions, and situations (notification, settings, Spring Board). I’ve crafted a tool called IconGenerator, which was previously mentioned in Best Open Source Tools For Developers. Drag the icon that you want — I prefer those with 1024x1024 pixels for high resolution app icons — to the Icon Generator MacOS app. Click Generate and we get AppIcon.appiconset . This contains app icons of the required sizes that are ready to be used in Asset Catalog. Drag this to Asset Catalog in Xcode. That is for production. For staging, it’s good practice to add a “Staging” banner so that testers know which is staging, and which is production. We can easily do this in Sketch. Remember to set a background, so we don’t get a transparent background. For an app icon with transparent background, iOS shows the background as black which looks horrible. After exporting the image, drag the staging icon to the IconGenerator the same way we did earlier. But this time, rename the generated appiconset to AppIcon-Staging.appiconset. Then drag this to Asset Catalog in Xcode. For the staging target to use staging app icons, open MyApp Staging target and choose AppIcon-Staging as App Icon Source. Add app icon for Android I like to switch to Project view, as it is easier to change app icons. Click res -&gt; New -&gt; Image Asset to open Asset Studio. We can use the same app icons that we used in iOS: Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduced Adaptive Icons so we need to tweak the Resize slider to make sure our app icons look as nice as possible. Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduces adaptive launcher icons, which can display a variety of shapes across different device models. For example, an adaptive launcher icon can display a circular shape on one OEM device, and display a squircle on another device. Each device OEM provides a mask, which the system then uses to render all adaptive icons with the same shape. Adaptive launcher icons are also used in shortcuts, the Settings app, sharing dialogs, and the overview screen. — Android developers We are doing for production first, which means the main Res Directory. This step will replace the existing placeholder app icons generated by Android Studio when we bootstrapped React Native projects. Now that we have production app icons, let’s make staging app icons. Android manages code and assets via convention. Click on src -&gt; New -&gt; Directory and create a staging folder. Inside staging, create a folder called res . Anything we place in staging will replace the ones in main — this is called source sets. You can read more here: Build with source sets. You can use source set directories to contain the code and resources you want packaged only with certain configurations. For example, if you are building the “demoDebug” build variant, which is the crossproduct of a “demo” product flavor and “debug” build type, Gradle looks at these directories, and gives them the following priority:src/demoDebug/ (build variant source set)src/debug/ (build type source set)src/demo/ (product flavor source set)src/main/ (main source set) Right click on staging/res -&gt; New -&gt; Image Asset to make app icons for staging. We also use the same staging app icons like in iOS, but this time we choose staging as Res Directory. This way Android Studio knows how to generate different ic_launcher and put them into staging. Add launch screen for iOSThe splash screen is called a [Launch Screen](http://Launch Screen) in iOS, and it is important. A launch screen appears instantly when your app starts up. The launch screen is quickly replaced with the first screen of your app, giving the impression that your app is fast and responsive In the old days, we needed to use static launch images with different sizes for each device and orientation. Launch Screen storyboardFor now the recommended way is to use Launch Screen storyboard . The iOS project from React Native comes with LaunchScreen.xib but xib is a thing of the past. Let’s delete it and create a file called Launch Screen.storyboard . Right click on MyApp folder -&gt; New and chose Launch Screen, add it to both targets as usually we show the same splash screen for both staging and production. Image SetOpen asset catalog, right click and select New Image Set . We can name it anything. This will be used in the Launch Screen.storyboard. Open Launch Screen.storyboard and add an UIImageView . If you are using Xcode 10, click the Library button in the upper right corner and choose Show Objects Library. Set image for Image View, and make sure Content Mode is set to Aspect Filled, as this ensures that the image always covers the full screen (although it may be cropped). Then connect ImageView using constraints to the View, not the Safe Area. You do this by Control+drag from the Image View (splash) to the View. Constrains without marginClick into each constraint and uncheck Relative to Margin. This makes our ImageView pin to the very edges of the view and with no margin at all. Now go to both targets and select Launch Screen.storyboard as Launch Screen File: On iOS, the launch screen is often cached, so you probably won’t see the changes. One way to avoid that is to delete the app and run it again. Add a launcher theme for AndroidThere are several ways to add splash screen for Android, from using launcher themes, Splash Activity, and a timer. For me, a reasonable splash screen for Android should be a very minimal image. As there are many Android devices with different ratios and resolutions, if you want to show a full screen splash image, it will probably not scale correctly for each device. This is just about UX. For the splash screen, let’s use the launcher theme with splash_background.xml . Learn about Device MetricThere is no single splash image that suits all Android devices. A more logical approach is to create multiple splash images for all common resolutions in portrait and landscape. Or we can design a minimal splash image that works. You can find more info here: Device Metric. Here is how to add splash screen in 4 easy steps: Add splash imageWe usually need a common splash screen for both staging and production. Drag an image into main/res/drawble . Android Studio seems to have a problem with recognising some jpg images for the splash screen, so it’s best to choose png images. Add splash_background.xmlRight click on drawable -&gt; New -&gt; Drawable resource file . Name it whatever you want — I choose splash_background.xml . Choose the root element as layer-list: A [Layer List](http://Layer List) means “a Drawable that manages an array of other Drawables. These are drawn in array order, so the element with the largest index is drawn on top”. Here is how splash_background.xml looks like: &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt; &lt;!-- The android:opacity=”opaque” line — this is critical in preventing a flash of black as your theme transitions. --&gt; &lt;layer-list xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot; android:opacity=&quot;opaque&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- The background color, preferably the same as your normal theme --&gt; &lt;item android:drawable=&quot;@android:color/white&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- Your splash image --&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;bitmap android:src=&quot;@drawable/iron_man&quot; android:gravity=&quot;center&quot;/&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/layer-list&gt;Note that we point to our splash image we added earlier with android:src=”@drawable/iron_man”. Declare styleOpen styles.xml and add SplashTheme: &lt;style name=&quot;SplashTheme&quot; parent=&quot;Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar&quot;&gt; &lt;item name=&quot;android:windowBackground&quot;&gt;@drawable/splash_background&lt;/item&gt; &lt;/style&gt;Use SplashThemeGo to Manifest.xml and change the theme of the the launcher activity, which has category android:name=”android.intent.category.LAUNCHER” . Change it to android:theme=”@style/SplashTheme” . For React Native, the launcher activity is usually MainActivity . Here is how Manifest.xml looks: &lt;manifest xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot; package=&quot;com.myapp&quot;&gt; &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.INTERNET&quot; /&gt; &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW&quot;/&gt; &lt;application android:name=&quot;.MainApplication&quot; android:label=&quot;@string/app_name&quot; android:icon=&quot;@mipmap/ic_launcher&quot; android:allowBackup=&quot;false&quot; android:theme=&quot;@style/AppTheme&quot;&gt; &lt;activity android:name=&quot;.MainActivity&quot; android:label=&quot;@string/app_name&quot; android:configChanges=&quot;keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize&quot; android:theme=&quot;@style/SplashTheme&quot; android:windowSoftInputMode=&quot;adjustResize&quot;&gt; &lt;intent-filter&gt; &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.MAIN&quot; /&gt; &lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.LAUNCHER&quot; /&gt; &lt;/intent-filter&gt; &lt;/activity&gt; &lt;activity android:name=&quot;com.facebook.react.devsupport.DevSettingsActivity&quot; /&gt; &lt;/application&gt; &lt;/manifest&gt;Run the app now and you should see the splash screen showing when the app starts. Managing environment configurationsThe differences between staging and production are just about app names, application ids, and app icons. We probably use different API keys, and backend URL for staging and production. Right now the most popular library to handle these scenarios is react-native-config, which is said to “bring some 12 factor love to your mobile apps”. It requires lots of steps to get started, and I hope there is a less verbose solution. Where to go from hereIn this post, we touched Xcode and Android Studio more than Visual Studio Code, but this was inevitable. I hope this post was useful to you.

It works by providing a common interface that talks to native iOS and Android components. There are enough essentials components to get started, but the cooler thing is that it is easy to build our own, hence we are not limited by React Native. In this post we will implement a linear gradient view, which is not supported by default in React Native, using native UI component, particularly CAGradientLayer in iOS and GradientDrawable in Android. In Javascript there are hundreds of libraries for a single problem and you should check if you really need it or not. A search on Google for linear gradient shows a bunch of libraries, like react-native-linear-gradient. The less dependencies the better. Linear gradient is in fact very easy to build and we probably don’t need to add extra dependencies. Also integrating and following updates with 3rd libraries are painful, I would avoid that as much as possible. Native UI component vs Native moduleIn React Native, there are native UI component and native module. React Native moves pretty fast so most of the articles will be outdated, it’s best to consult official documentation for the latest React Native version. This post will try to give you overview of the whole picture because for now the official guide seems not completed. Native Modules in iOS Native Modules in Android Native UI Components in iOS Native UI Components in Android In simple explanation, native UI component is about making UIView in iOS or View in Android available as React.Component and used in render function in Javascript. There are tons of native UI widgets out there ready to be used in the latest apps — some of them are part of the platform, others are available as third-party libraries, and still more might be in use in your very own portfolio. React Native has several of the most critical platform components already wrapped, like ScrollView and TextInput, but not all of them, and certainly not ones you might have written yourself for a previous app. Native module is more general in that we make any native class available in Javascript. Sometimes an app needs access to platform API, and React Native doesn’t have a corresponding module yet. Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift or C++ code without having to reimplement it in JavaScript, or write some high performance, multi-threaded code such as for image processing, a database, or any number of advanced extensions. View ManagerTo expose native UI views, we use the ViewManager as the bridge, it is RCTViewManager in iOS and SimpleViewManager in Android. Then inside this ViewManager we can just return our custom view. I see it’s good to use Objective C/Java for the ViewManager to match React Native classes, and the custom view we can use either Swift/Objective C in iOS and Kotlin/Java in Android. I prefer to use Swift, but in this post to remove the overhead of introducing bridging header from Swift to Objective C, we use Objective C for simplicity. We also add the native source code directly into iOS and Android project, but in the future we can extract them easily to a React Native library. For now let ‘s use the name RNGradientViewManager and RNGradientView to stay consistent between iOS and Android. The RN prefix is arbitrary, you can use any prefix you want, but here I use it to indicate that these classes are meant to be used in Javascript side in React Native. Implement in iOSProject structureAdd these Objective-C classes to the projects, I usually place them inside NativeComponents folder Native views are created and manipulated by subclasses of RCTViewManager. These subclasses are similar in function to view controllers, but are essentially singletons - only one instance of each is created by the bridge. They expose native views to the RCTUIManager, which delegates back to them to set and update the properties of the views as necessary. The RCTViewManagers are also typically the delegates for the views, sending events back to JavaScript via the bridge. RNGradientViewManagerCreate a RNGradientViewManager that inherits from RCTViewManager RNGradientViewManager.h #import &lt;React/RCTViewManager.h&gt; @interface RNGradientViewManager : RCTViewManager @endRNGradientViewManager.m #import &quot;RNGradientViewManager.h&quot; #import &quot;RNGradientView.h&quot; [@implementation](http://twitter.com/implementation) RNGradientViewManager RCT_EXPORT_MODULE() - (UIView *)view { return [[RNGradientView alloc] init]; } RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(progress, NSNumber); RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(cornerRadius, NSNumber); RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(fromColor, UIColor); RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(toColor, UIColor); [@end](http://twitter.com/end)In iOS we use macro RCT_EXPORT_MODULE() to automatically register the module with the bridge when it loads. The optional js_name argument will be used as the JS module name. If omitted, the JS module name will match the Objective-C class name. #define RCT_EXPORT_MODULE(js_name)The ViewManager, not the View, is the facade to the Javascript side, so we expose properties using RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY . Note that we do that inside @implementation RNGradientViewManager Here we specify the types as NSNumber and UIColor , and later in Javascript we can just pass number and color hex string, and React Native can do the conversions for us. In older versions of React Native, we need processColor in Javascript or RCTConvert color in iOS side, but we don’t need to perform manual conversion now. RNGradientViewIn the Native UI component example for iOS, they use WKWebView but here we make a RNGradientView which subclasses from RCTView to take advantage of many features of React Native views, and to avoid some problems we can get if using a normal UIView RNGradientView.h #import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt; #import &lt;React/RCTView.h&gt; [@interface](http://twitter.com/interface) RNGradientView : RCTView [@end](http://twitter.com/end)RNGradientView.m #import &quot;RNGradientView.h&quot; #import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt; [@interface](http://twitter.com/interface) RNGradientView() [@property](http://twitter.com/property) CAGradientLayer *gradientLayer; [@property](http://twitter.com/property) UIColor *_fromColor; [@property](http://twitter.com/property) UIColor *_toColor; [@property](http://twitter.com/property) NSNumber *_progress; [@property](http://twitter.com/property) NSNumber *_cornerRadius; [@end](http://twitter.com/end) [@implementation](http://twitter.com/implementation) RNGradientView // MARK: - Init - (instancetype)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame { self = [super initWithFrame:frame]; if (self) { self.gradientLayer = [self makeGradientLayer]; [self.layer addSublayer:self.gradientLayer]; self._fromColor = [UIColor blackColor]; self._toColor = [UIColor whiteColor]; self._progress = [@0](http://twitter.com/0).5; [self update]; } return self; } // MARK: - Life cycle - (void)layoutSubviews { [super layoutSubviews]; self.gradientLayer.frame = CGRectMake( 0, 0, self.bounds.size.width*self._progress.floatValue, self.bounds.size.height ); } // MARK: - Properties - (void)setFromColor:(UIColor *)color { self._fromColor = color; [self update]; } - (void)setToColor:(UIColor *)color { self._toColor = color; [self update]; } - (void)setProgress:(NSNumber *)progress { self._progress = progress; [self update]; } - (void)setCornerRadius:(NSNumber *)cornerRadius { self._cornerRadius = cornerRadius; [self update]; } // MARK: - Helper - (void)update { self.gradientLayer.colors = @[ (id)self._fromColor.CGColor, (id)self._toColor.CGColor ]; self.gradientLayer.cornerRadius = self._cornerRadius.floatValue; [self setNeedsLayout]; } - (CAGradientLayer *)makeGradientLayer { CAGradientLayer *gradientLayer = [CAGradientLayer layer]; gradientLayer.masksToBounds = true; gradientLayer.startPoint = CGPointMake(0.0, 0.5); gradientLayer.endPoint = CGPointMake(1.0, 0.5); gradientLayer.anchorPoint = CGPointZero; return gradientLayer; } [@end](http://twitter.com/end)We can implement anything we want in this native view, in this case we use CAGradientLayer to get nicely displayed linear gradient. Since RNGradientViewManager exposes some properties like progress, cornerRadius, fromColor, toColor we need to implement some setters as they will be called by React Native when we update values in Javascript side. In the setter we call setNeedsLayout to tell the view to invalidate the layout, hence layoutSubviews will be called again. requireNativeComponentOpen project in Visual Studio Code, add GradientView.js to src/nativeComponents . The folder name is arbitrary, but it’s good to stay organised. import { requireNativeComponent } from &apos;react-native&apos; module.exports = requireNativeComponent(&apos;RNGradientView&apos;, null)Here we use requireNativeComponent to load our RNGradientView . We only need this one Javascript file for interacting with both iOS and Android. You can name the module as RNGradientView but I think the practice in Javascript is that we don’t use prefix, so we name just GradientView . const requireNativeComponent = (uiViewClassName: string): string =&gt; createReactNativeComponentClass(uiViewClassName, () =&gt; getNativeComponentAttributes(uiViewClassName), ); module.exports = requireNativeComponent;Before I tried to use export default for the native component, but this way the view is not rendered at all, even if I wrap it inside React.Component . It seems we must use module.exports for the native component to be properly loaded. Now using it is as easy as declare the GradientView with JSX syntax import GradientView from &apos;nativeComponents/GradientView&apos; export default class Profile extends React.Component { render() { return ( &lt;SafeAreaView style={styles.container}&gt; &lt;GradientView style={styles.progress} fromColor={R.colors.progress.from} toColor={R.colors.progress.to} cornerRadius={5.0} progress={0.8} /&gt; ) } }Implement in AndroidProject structureAdd these Java classes to the projects, I usually place them inside nativeComponents folder RNGradientManagerCreate a RNGradientManager that extends SimpleViewManagerRNGradientManager.java package com.onmyway133.myApp.nativeComponents; import android.support.annotation.Nullable; import com.facebook.react.uimanager.SimpleViewManager; import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ThemedReactContext; import com.facebook.react.uimanager.annotations.ReactProp; public class RNGradientViewManager extends SimpleViewManager&lt;RNGradientView&gt; { [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) public String getName() { return &quot;RNGradientView&quot;; } [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) protected RNGradientView createViewInstance(ThemedReactContext reactContext) { return new RNGradientView(reactContext); } // Properties [@ReactProp](http://twitter.com/ReactProp)(name = &quot;progress&quot;) public void setProgress(RNGradientView view, [@Nullable](http://twitter.com/Nullable) float progress) { view.setProgress(progress); } [@ReactProp](http://twitter.com/ReactProp)(name = &quot;cornerRadius&quot;) public void setCornerRadius(RNGradientView view, [@Nullable](http://twitter.com/Nullable) float cornerRadius) { view.setCornerRadius(cornerRadius); } [@ReactProp](http://twitter.com/ReactProp)(name = &quot;fromColor&quot;, customType = &quot;Color&quot;) public void setFromColor(RNGradientView view, [@Nullable](http://twitter.com/Nullable) int color) { view.setFromColor(color); } [@ReactProp](http://twitter.com/ReactProp)(name = &quot;toColor&quot;, customType = &quot;Color&quot;) public void setToColor(RNGradientView view, [@Nullable](http://twitter.com/Nullable) int color) { view.setToColor(color); } }We usually use Color as android.graphics.Color , but for the GradientDrawable that we are going to use, it use color as ARGB integer. So it’s nifty that React Native deals with Color as int type. We also need to specify customType = “Color” as Color is something kinda custom. RNGradientViewThis is where we implement our view, we can do that in Kotlin if we like. RNGradientView.java package com.onmyway133.myApp.nativeComponents; import android.content.Context; import android.graphics.drawable.GradientDrawable; import android.graphics.drawable.ScaleDrawable; import android.support.annotation.Nullable; import android.util.AttributeSet; import android.view.Gravity; import android.view.View; public class RNGradientView extends View { float progress; float cornerRadius; int fromColor; int toColor; public RNGradientView(Context context) { super(context); } public RNGradientView(Context context, @Nullable AttributeSet attrs) { super(context, attrs); } public RNGradientView(Context context, @Nullable AttributeSet attrs, int defStyleAttr) { super(context, attrs, defStyleAttr); } public RNGradientView(Context context, @Nullable AttributeSet attrs, int defStyleAttr, int defStyleRes) { super(context, attrs, defStyleAttr, defStyleRes); } // update void update() { GradientDrawable gradient = new GradientDrawable(); gradient.setColors(new int[] { this.fromColor, this.toColor }); gradient.setOrientation(GradientDrawable.Orientation.*LEFT_RIGHT*); gradient.setGradientType(GradientDrawable.*LINEAR_GRADIENT*); gradient.setShape(GradientDrawable.*RECTANGLE*); gradient.setCornerRadius(this.cornerRadius * 4); ScaleDrawable scale = new ScaleDrawable(gradient, Gravity.*LEFT*, 1, -1); scale.setLevel((int)(this.progress * 10000)); this.setBackground(scale); } // Getter &amp; setter public void setProgress(float progress) { this.progress = progress; this.update(); } public void setCornerRadius(float cornerRadius) { this.cornerRadius = cornerRadius; this.update(); } public void setFromColor(int fromColor) { this.fromColor = fromColor; this.update(); } public void setToColor(int toColor) { this.toColor = toColor; this.update(); } }Pay attention to the setColors as it use an array of int Sets the colors used to draw the gradient.Each color is specified as an ARGB integer and the array must contain at least 2 colors. If we call setBackground with the GradientDrawable it will be stretched to fill the view. In our case we want to support progress which determines how long the gradient should show. To fix that we use ScaleDrawable which is a Drawable that changes the size of another Drawable based on its current level value. The same value for cornerRadius works in iOS, but for Android we need to use higher values, that’s why the multiplication in gradient.setCornerRadius(this.cornerRadius * 4) Shape drawableAnother way to implement gradient is to use Shape Drawable with xml , it’s the equivalent of using xib in iOS. We can create something like gradient.xml and put that inside /res/drawable &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt; &lt;shape xmlns:android=&quot;[http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android](http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android)&quot; android:shape=&quot;rectangle&quot;&gt; &lt;gradient android:startColor=&quot;#3B5998&quot; android:endColor=&quot;#00000000&quot; android:angle=&quot;45&quot;/&gt; &lt;/shape&gt;For more information, you can readAndroid Shape Drawables TutorialHave you ever wanted to reduce your Android application’s size or make it look more interesting? If yes, then you…android.jlelse.eu We can also use the class directly ShapeDrawable in code A Drawable object that draws primitive shapes. A ShapeDrawable takes a Shape object and manages its presence on the screen. If no Shape is given, then the ShapeDrawable will default to a RectShape.This object can be defined in an XML file with the element. GradientManagerPackageIn iOS we use RCT_EXPORT_MODULE to register the component, but in Android, things are done explicitly using Package . A package can register both native module and native UI component. In this case we deal with just UI component, so let’s return RNGradientManager in createViewManagers GradientManagerPackage.java package com.onmyway133.myApp.nativeComponents; import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage; import com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule; import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext; import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ViewManager; import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.Collections; import java.util.List; public class RNGradientViewPackage implements ReactPackage { [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) public List&lt;NativeModule&gt; createNativeModules(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) { return Collections.emptyList(); } [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) public List&lt;ViewManager&gt; createViewManagers(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) { return Arrays.&lt;ViewManager&gt;asList( new RNGradientViewManager() ); } }Then head over to MainApplication.java to declare our package [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) protected List&lt;ReactPackage&gt; getPackages() { return Arrays.&lt;ReactPackage&gt;asList( new MainReactPackage(), new RNGradientViewPackage() ); }That’s it for Android. We already have the GradientView.js written earlier, when running the app in Android, it will look up and load our RNGradientView Where to go from hereHope you learn something about native UI component. In the post we only touch the surfaces on what native UI component can do, which is just passing configurations from Javascript to native.

At least that’s according to my initial assumption. This article aims to detail what I have learned about keyboard handling and how to avoid extra tap when dealing with TextInput There will also be lots of code spelunking, thanks to the all the libraries being open source. The version of React Native I’m using at the time of writing is 0.57.5 The built in TextInput componentReact Native comes with a bunch of basic components, one of them is the TextInput for inputting text into the app via a keyboard. import React, { Component } from &apos;react&apos;; import { AppRegistry, TextInput } from &apos;react-native&apos;; export default class UselessTextInput extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { text: &apos;Useless Placeholder&apos; }; } render() { return ( &lt;TextInput style={{height: 40, borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1}} onChangeText={(text) =&gt; this.setState({text})} value={this.state.text} /&gt; ); } }That’s it, whenever we click on the text input, keyboard appears allowing us to enter values. To dismiss the keyboard by pressing anywhere on the screen, the easy solution is to TouchableWithoutFeedback together with Keyboard . This is similar to having UITapGestureRecognizer in iOS UIView and calling view.endEditing import { Keyboard } from &apos;react-native&apos; Keyboard.dismiss()TextInput inside ScrollViewNormally we should have some text inputs inside a scrolling component, in React Native that is mostly ScrollView to be able to handle long list of content and avoid keyboard. If TextInput is inside ScrollView then the way keyboard gets dismissed behaves a bit differently, and depends on keyboardShouldPersistTaps Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap. ‘never’ (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won’t receive the tap. ‘always’, the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps. ‘handled’, the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor). The never mode should be the desired behaviour in most cases, clicking anywhere outside the focused text input should dismiss the keyboard. In my app, there are some text inputs and an action button. The scenario is that users enter some infos and then press that button to register data. With the never mode, we have to press button twice, one for dismissing the keyboard, and two for the onPress of the Button . So the solution is to use always mode. This way the Button always gets the press event first. &lt;ScrollView keyboardShouldPersistTaps=&apos;always&apos; /&gt;ScrollView cares about keyboardThe native RCTScrollView class that power react native ScrollView has code to handle dismiss mode RCT_SET_AND_PRESERVE_OFFSET(setKeyboardDismissMode, keyboardDismissMode, UIScrollViewKeyboardDismissMode)The option that it chooses is UIScrollViewKeyboardDismissMode for keyboardDismissMode property The manner in which the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins in the scroll view. As you can see, the possible modes are onDrag and interactive . And react native exposes customization point for this via keyboardShouldPersistTaps case none The keyboard does not get dismissed with a drag. case onDrag The keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins. case interactive The keyboard follows the dragging touch offscreen, and can be pulled upward again to cancel the dismiss. ScrollView inside a ModalBut that does not work when ScrollView is inside Modal . By Modal I meant the Modal component in React Native. The only library that I use is react-navigation , and it supports Opening a full-screen modal too, but they way we declare modal in react-navigation looks like stack and it is confusing, so I would rather not use it. I use Modal in react-native and that works pretty well. So if we have TextInput inside ScrollView inside Modal then keyboardShouldPersistTaps does not work. Modal seems to be aware of parent ScrollView so we have to declare keyboardShouldPersistTaps=’always’ on every parent ScrollView . In React Native FlatList and SectionList uses ScrollView under the hood, so we need to be aware of all those ScrollView components. Spelunking react-navigationSince my app relies heavily on react-navigation , it’s good to have a deep understanding about its components so we make sure where the problem lies. I’ve written a bit about react-navigation structure below.Using react-navigation 3.0 in React Native appsreact-navigation is probably the only dependency I use in React Native apps. I’m happy with it so far, then version 3.0…codeburst.io Like every traditional mobile apps, my app consists of many stack navigators inside tab navigator. In iOS that means many UINavigationViewController inside UITabbarController . In react-navigation I use createMaterialTopTabNavigator inside createBottomTabNavigator import { createMaterialTopTabNavigator } from &apos;react-navigation&apos; import { createBottomTabNavigator, BottomTabBar } from &apos;react-navigation-tabs&apos;The screen I have keyboard issue is a Modal presented from the 2nd screen in one of the stack navigators, so let’s examine every possible ScrollView up the hierarchy. This process involves lots of code reading and this’s how I love open source. First let’s start with createBottomTabNavigator which uses createTabNavigator together with its own TabNavigationView class TabNavigationView extends React.PureComponent&lt;Props, State&gt; export default createTabNavigator(TabNavigationView);Tab navigator has tab bar view below ScreenContainer , which is used to contain view. ScreenContainer is from react-native-screens “This project aims to expose native navigation container components to React Native”. Below is how tab navigator works. render() { const { navigation, renderScene, lazy } = this.props; const { routes } = navigation.state; const { loaded } = this.state return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; &lt;ScreenContainer style={styles.pages}&gt; {routes.map((route, index) =&gt; { if (lazy &amp;&amp; !loaded.includes(index)) { // Don&apos;t render a screen if we&apos;ve never navigated to it return null; const isFocused = navigation.state.index === index return ( &lt;ResourceSavingScene key={route.key} style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill} isVisible={isFocused} &gt; {renderScene({ route })} &lt;/ResourceSavingScene&gt; ); })} &lt;/ScreenContainer&gt; {this._renderTabBar()} &lt;/View&gt; ); }Tab bar is rendered using BottomTabBar in _renderTabBar function. Looking at the code, the whole tab navigator has nothing to do with ScrollView . So there is only createMaterialTopTabNavigator left on the suspecting list. I use it in the app with swipeEnabled: true . And by looking at the imports, top tab navigator has import MaterialTopTabBar, { type TabBarOptions,} from &apos;../views/MaterialTopTabBar&apos;;MaterialTopTabBar has import from react-native-tab-view import { TabBar } from &apos;react-native-tab-view&apos;;which has ScrollView &lt;View style={styles.scroll}&gt; &lt;Animated.ScrollView horizontal keyboardShouldPersistTaps=&quot;handled&quot;The property keyboardShouldPersistTaps was initial set to always , then set back to handled to avoid the bug that we can’t press any button in tab bar while keyboard is open https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view/issues/375 But this TabBar has nothing with our problem, because it’s just for containing tab bar buttons. Swiping in createMaterialTopTabNavigatorTaking another look at createMaterialTopTabNavigator we see more imports from react-native-tab-view import { TabView, PagerPan } from &apos;react-native-tab-view&apos;;TabView has swipeEnabled passed in return ( &lt;TabView {...rest} navigationState={navigation.state} animationEnabled={animationEnabled} swipeEnabled={swipeEnabled} onAnimationEnd={this._handleAnimationEnd} onIndexChange={this._handleIndexChange} onSwipeStart={this._handleSwipeStart} renderPager={renderPager} renderTabBar={this._renderTabBar} renderScene={ /* $FlowFixMe */ this._renderScene } /&gt; );and it renders PagerDefault, which in turn uses PagerScroll for iOS import { Platform } from &apos;react-native&apos;; let Pager; switch (Platform.OS) { case &apos;android&apos;: Pager = require(&apos;./PagerAndroid&apos;).default; break; case &apos;ios&apos;: Pager = require(&apos;./PagerScroll&apos;).default; break; default: Pager = require(&apos;./PagerPan&apos;).default; break; } export default Pager;So PagerScroll uses ScrollView to handle scrolling to match material style that user can scroll between pages, and it has keyboardShouldPersistTaps=”always” which should be correct. return ( &lt;ScrollView horizontal pagingEnabled directionalLockEnabled keyboardDismissMode=&quot;on-drag&quot; keyboardShouldPersistTaps=&quot;always&quot;So nothing looks suspicious in react-navigation , which urges me to look at code from my project. Debugging FlatList, SectionList and ScrollViewLike I stated in the beginning of this article, the root problem is that we need to declare keyboardShouldPersistTaps for all parent ScrollView in the hierarchy. That means to look out for any FlatList, SectionList and ScrollView Luckily, there is react-devtools that shows tree of all rendered components in react app, and that is also guided in Debugging section of react native. You can use the standalone version of React Developer Tools to debug the React component hierarchy. To use it, install the react-devtools package globally: npm install -g react-devtoolsSo after searching I found out that there is a SectionList up the hierarchy that should have keyboardShouldPersistTaps=’always’ while it didn’t. Taking a thorough look at the code, I found out that the Modal is trigged from a SectionList item. We already know that triggering Modal in react native means that to embed that Modal inside the view hierarchy and control its visibility via a state. So in terms of view and component, that Modal is inside a SectionList . And for your interest, if you dive deep into react native code, SectionList in my case is just VirtualizedSectionList , which is VirtualizedList, which uses ScrollView So after I declare keyboardShouldPersistTaps=’always’ in that SectionList , the problem is solved. User can now just enters some values in the text inputs, then press once on the submit button to submit data. The button now captures touch events first instead of scrollview. Where to go from hereThe solution for this is fortunately simple as it involves fixing our code without having to alter react-navigation code. But it’s good to look at the library code to know what it does, and to trace where the problem originates.

It all depends on your personal taste and the project you’re working on. In this post, we will go through how to structure a project and how to manage local assets. This of course is not written in stone, and you are free to apply only the pieces that suit you. Hope you learn something. For a project bootstrapped with react-native init , we get only the basic structure. There is the ios folder for Xcode projects, the android folder for Android projects, and an index.js and an App.js file for the React Native starting point. ios/ android/ index.js App.jsAs someone who has worked with native on both Windows Phone, iOS and Android, I find that structuring a project all comes down to separating files by type or feature type vs featureSeparating by type means that we organise files by their type. If it is a component, there are container and presentational files. If it is Redux, there are action, reducer, and store files. If it is view, there are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files. Group by typeredux actions store reducers components container presentational view javascript html cssThis way, we can see the type of each file, and easily run a script toward a certain file type. This is general for all projects, but it does not answer the question “what is this project about?” Is it news application? Is it a loyalty app? Is it about nutrition tracking? Organising files by type is for a machine, not for a human. Many times we work on a feature, and finding files to fix in multiple directories is a hassle. It’s also a pain if we plan to make a framework out of our project, as files are spread across many places. Group by featureA more reasonable solution is to organise files by feature. Files related to a feature should be placed together. And test files should stay close to the source files. Check out this article to learn more. A feature can be related to login, sign up, onboarding, or a user’s profile. A feature can contain sub-features as long as they belong to the same flow. If we wanted to move the sub feature around, it would be easy, as all related files are already grouped together. My typical project structure based on features looks like this: index.js App.js ios/ android/ src screens login LoginScreen.js LoginNavigator.js onboarding OnboardingNavigator welcome WelcomeScreen.js term TermScreen.js notification NotificationScreen.js main MainNavigator.js news NewsScreen.js profile ProfileScreen.js search SearchScreen.js library package.json components ImageButton.js RoundImage.js utils moveToBottom.js safeArea.js networking API.js Auth.js res package.json strings.js colors.js palette.js fonts.js images.js images logo@2x.png logo@3x.png button@2x.png button@3x.png scripts images.js clear.jsBesides the traditional files App.js and index.js and the ios1 and android folders, I put all the source files inside the src folder. Inside src I have res for resources, library for common files used across features, and screens for a screen of content. As few dependencies as possibleSince React Native is heavily dependent on tons of dependencies, I try to be pretty aware when adding more. In my project I use just react-navigation for navigation. And I’m not a fan of redux as it adds unneeded complexity. Only add a dependency when you really need it, otherwise you are just setting yourself up for more trouble than value. The thing I like about React is the components. A component is where we define view, style and behavior. React has inline style — it’s like using JavaScript to define script, HTML and CSS. This fits the feature approach we are aiming for. That’s why I don’t use styled-components. Since styles are just JavaScript objects, we can just share comment styles in library . srcI like Android a lot, so I name src and res to match its folder conventions. react-native init sets up babel for us. But for a typical JavaScript project, it’s good to organise files in the src folder. In my electron.js application IconGenerator, I put the source files inside the src folder. This not only helps in terms of organising, but also helps babel transpile the entire folder at once. Just a command and I have the files in src transpiled to dist in a blink. babel ./src --out-dir ./dist --copy-filesScreenReact is based around components. Yup. There are container and presentational components, but we can compose components to build more complex components. They usually end in showing in the full screen. It is called Page in Windows Phone, ViewController in iOS and Activity in Android. The React Native guide mentions screen very often as something that covers the entire space: Mobile apps are rarely made up of a single screen. Managing the presentation of, and transition between, multiple screens is typically handled by what is known as a navigator. index.js or not?Each screen is considered the entry point for each feature. You can rename the LoginScreen.js to index.js by leveraging the Node module feature: Modules don’t have to be files. We can also create a find-me folder under node_modules and place an index.js file in there. The same require(‘find-me’) line will use that folder’s index.js file So instead of import LoginScreen from ‘./screens/LoginScreen’ , we can just do import LoginScreen from ‘./screens’. Using index.js results in encapsulation and provides a public interface for the feature. This is all personal taste. I myself prefer explicit naming for a file, hence the name LoginScreen.js. Navigatorreact-navigation seems to be the most popular choice for handling navigation in a React Native app. For a feature like onboarding, there are probably many screens managed by a stack navigation, so there is OnboardingNavigator . You can think of Navigator as something that groups sub screens or features. Since we group by feature, it’s reasonable to place Navigator inside the feature folder. It basically looks like this: import { createStackNavigator } from &apos;react-navigation&apos; import Welcome from &apos;./Welcome&apos; import Term from &apos;./Term&apos; const routeConfig = { Welcome: { screen: Welcome }, Term: { screen: Term } } const navigatorConfig = { navigationOptions: { header: null } } export default OnboardingNavigator = createStackNavigator(routeConfig, navigatorConfig)libraryThis is the most controversial part of structuring a project. If you don’t like the name library, you can name it utilities, common, citadel , whatever… This is not meant for homeless files, but it is where we place common utilities and components that are used by many features. Things like atomic components, wrappers, quick fixes function, networking stuff, and login info are used a lot, and it’s hard to move them to a specific feature folder. Sometimes we just need to be practical and get the work done. In React Native, we often need to implement a button with an image background in many screens. Here is a simple one that stays inside library/components/ImageButton.js . The components folder is for reusable components, sometimes called atomic components. According to React naming conventions, the first letter should be uppercase. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738import React from 'react'import &#123; TouchableOpacity, View, Image, Text, StyleSheet &#125; from 'react-native'import images from 'res/images'import colors from 'res/colors'export default class ImageButton extends React.Component &#123; render() &#123; return ( &lt;TouchableOpacity style=&#123;styles.touchable&#125; onPress=&#123;this.props.onPress&#125;&gt; &lt;View style=&#123;styles.view&#125;&gt; &lt;Text style=&#123;styles.text&#125;&gt;&#123;this.props.title&#125;&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;/View&gt; &lt;Image source=&#123;images.button&#125; style=&#123;styles.image&#125; /&gt; &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt; ) &#125;&#125;const styles = StyleSheet.create(&#123; view: &#123; position: 'absolute', backgroundColor: 'transparent' &#125;, image: &#123; &#125;, touchable: &#123; alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' &#125;, text: &#123; color: colors.button, fontSize: 18, textAlign: 'center' &#125;&#125;) And if we want to place the button at the bottom, we use a utility function to prevent code duplication. Here is library/utils/moveToBottom.js: import React from &apos;react&apos; import { View, StyleSheet } from &apos;react-native&apos; function moveToBottom(component) { return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; {component} &lt;/View&gt; ) } const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, justifyContent: &apos;flex-end&apos;, marginBottom: 36 } }) export default moveToBottomUse package.json to avoid relative pathThen somewhere in the src/screens/onboarding/term/Term.js , we can import by using relative paths: import moveToBottom from &apos;../../../../library/utils/move&apos; import ImageButton from &apos;../../../../library/components/ImageButton&apos;This is a big red flag in my eyes. It’s error prone, as we need to calculate how many .. we need to perform. And if we move feature around, all of the paths need to be recalculated. Since library is meant to be used many places, it’s good to reference it as an absolute path. In JavaScript there are usually 1000 libraries to a single problem. A quick search on Google reveals tons of libraries to tackle this issue. But we don’t need another dependency as this is extremely easy to fix. The solution is to turn library into a module so node can find it. Adding package.json to any folder makes it into a Node module . Add package.json inside the library folder with this simple content: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;library&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.1&quot; }Now in Term.js we can easily import things from library because it is now a module: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435import React from 'react'import &#123; View, StyleSheet, Image, Text, Button &#125; from 'react-native'import strings from 'res/strings'import palette from 'res/palette'import images from 'res/images'import ImageButton from 'library/components/ImageButton'import moveToBottom from 'library/utils/moveToBottom'export default class Term extends React.Component &#123; render() &#123; return ( &lt;View style=&#123;styles.container&#125;&gt; &lt;Text style=&#123;styles.heading&#125;&gt;&#123;strings.onboarding.term.heading.toUpperCase()&#125;&lt;/Text&gt; &#123; moveToBottom( &lt;ImageButton style=&#123;styles.button&#125; title=&#123;strings.onboarding.term.button.toUpperCase()&#125; /&gt; ) &#125; &lt;/View&gt; ) &#125;&#125;const styles = StyleSheet.create(&#123; container: &#123; flex: 1, alignItems: 'center' &#125;, heading: &#123; ...palette.heading, ...&#123; marginTop: 72 &#125; &#125;&#125;) resYou may wonder what res/colors, res/strings , res/images and res/fonts are in the above examples. Well, for front end projects, we usually have components and style them using fonts, localised strings, colors, images and styles. JavaScript is a very dynamic language, and it’s easy to use stringly types everywhere. We could have a bunch of #00B75D color across many files, or Fira as a fontFamily in many Text components. This is error-prone and hard to refactor. Let’s encapsulate resource usage inside the res folder with safer objects. They look like the examples below: res/colors const colors = { title: &apos;#00B75D&apos;, text: &apos;#0C222B&apos;, button: &apos;#036675&apos; } export default colorsres/strings const strings = { onboarding: { welcome: { heading: &apos;Welcome&apos;, text1: &quot;What you don&apos;t know is what you haven&apos;t learn&quot;, text2: &apos;Visit my GitHub at [https://github.com/onmyway133&apos;](https://github.com/onmyway133&apos;), button: &apos;Log in&apos; }, term: { heading: &apos;Terms and conditions&apos;, button: &apos;Read&apos; } } } export default stringsres/fonts const fonts = { title: &apos;Arial&apos;, text: &apos;SanFrancisco&apos;, code: &apos;Fira&apos; } export default fontsres/images const images = { button: require(&apos;./images/button.png&apos;), logo: require(&apos;./images/logo.png&apos;), placeholder: require(&apos;./images/placeholder.png&apos;) } export default imagesLike library , res files can be access from anywhere, so let’s make it a module . Add package.json to the res folder: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;res&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.1&quot; }so we can access resource files like normal modules: import strings from &apos;res/strings&apos; import palette from &apos;res/palette&apos; import images from &apos;res/images&apos;Group colors, images, fonts with paletteThe design of the app should be consistent. Certain elements should have the same look and feel so they don’t confuse the user. For example, the heading Text should use one color, font, and font size. The Image component should use the same placeholder image. In React Native, we already use the name styles with const styles = StyleSheet.create({}) so let’s use the name palette. Below is my simple palette. It defines common styles for heading and Text: res/paletteimport colors from &apos;./colors&apos; const palette = { heading: { color: colors.title, fontSize: 20, textAlign: &apos;center&apos; }, text: { color: colors.text, fontSize: 17, textAlign: &apos;center&apos; } } export default paletteAnd then we can use them in our screen: const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, alignItems: &apos;center&apos; }, heading: {...palette.heading, ...{ marginTop: 72 }} })Here we use the object spread operator to merge palette.heading and our custom style object. This means that we use the styles from palette.heading but also specify more properties. If we were to reskin the app for multiple brands, we could have multiple palettes. This is a really powerful pattern. Generate imagesYou can see that in /src/res/images.js we have properties for each image in the src/res/images folder: const images = { button: require(&apos;./images/button.png&apos;), logo: require(&apos;./images/logo.png&apos;), placeholder: require(&apos;./images/placeholder.png&apos;) } export default imagesThis is tedious to do manually, and we have to update if there’s changes in image naming convention. Instead, we can add a script to generate the images.js based on the images we have. Add a file at the root of the project /scripts/images.js: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233const fs = require('fs')const imageFileNames = () =&gt; &#123; const array = fs .readdirSync('src/res/images') .filter((file) =&gt; &#123; return file.endsWith('.png') &#125;) .map((file) =&gt; &#123; return file.replace('[@2x](http://twitter.com/2x).png', '').replace('[@3x](http://twitter.com/3x).png', '') &#125;) return Array.from(new Set(array))&#125;const generate = () =&gt; &#123; let properties = imageFileNames() .map((name) =&gt; &#123; return `$&#123;name&#125;: require('./images/$&#123;name&#125;.png')` &#125;) .join(',\\n ') const string = `const images = &#123; $&#123;properties&#125; &#125; export default images ` fs.writeFileSync('src/res/images.js', string, 'utf8')&#125;generate() The cool thing about Node is that we have access to the fs module, which is really good at file processing. Here we simply traverse through images, and update /src/res/images.js accordingly. Whenever we add or change images, we can run: node scripts/images.jsAnd we can also declare the script inside our main package.json : &quot;scripts&quot;: { &quot;start&quot;: &quot;node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start&quot;, &quot;test&quot;: &quot;jest&quot;, &quot;lint&quot;: &quot;eslint *.js **/*.js&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: &quot;node scripts/images.js&quot; }Now we can just run npm run images and we get an up-to-date images.js resource file. How about custom fontsReact Native has some custom fonts that may be good enough for your projects. You can also use custom fonts. One thing to note is that Android uses the name of the font file, but iOS uses the full name. You can see the full name in Font Book app, or by inspecting in running app for (NSString* family in [UIFont familyNames]) { NSLog(@&quot;%@&quot;, family); for (NSString* name in [UIFont fontNamesForFamilyName: family]) { NSLog(@&quot;Family name: %@&quot;, name); } }For custom fonts to be registered in iOS, we need to declare UIAppFonts in Info.plist using the file name of the fonts, and for Android, the fonts need to be placed at app/src/main/assets/fonts . It is good practice to name the font file the same as full name. React Native is said to dynamically load custom fonts, but in case you get “Unrecognized font family”, then simply add those fonts to target within Xcode. Doing this by hand takes time, luckily we have rnpm that can help. First add all the fonts inside res/fonts folder. Then simply declare rnpm in package.json and run react-native link . This should declare UIAppFonts in iOS and move all the fonts into app/src/main/assets/fonts for Android. &quot;rnpm&quot;: { &quot;assets&quot;: [ &quot;./src/res/fonts/&quot; ] }Accessing fonts by name is error prone, we can create a script similar to what we have done with images to generate a safer accession. Add fonts.js to our scripts folder 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031const fs = require('fs')const fontFileNames = () =&gt; &#123; const array = fs .readdirSync('src/res/fonts') .map((file) =&gt; &#123; return file.replace('.ttf', '') &#125;) return Array.from(new Set(array))&#125;const generate = () =&gt; &#123; const properties = fontFileNames() .map((name) =&gt; &#123; const key = name.replace(/\\s/g, '') return `$&#123;key&#125;: '$&#123;name&#125;'` &#125;) .join(',\\n ') const string = `const fonts = &#123; $&#123;properties&#125; &#125; export default fonts ` fs.writeFileSync('src/res/fonts.js', string, 'utf8')&#125;generate() Now you can use custom font via R namespace. 1234567import R from 'res/R'const styles = StyleSheet.create(&#123; text: &#123; fontFamily: R.fonts.FireCodeNormal &#125;&#125;) The R namespaceThis step depends on personal taste, but I find it more organised if we introduce the R namespace, just like how Android does for assets with the generated R class. Once you externalize your app resources, you can access them using resource IDs that are generated in your project’s Rclass. This document shows you how to group your resources in your Android project and provide alternative resources for specific device configurations, and then access them from your app code or other XML files. This way, let’s make a file called R.js in src/res: import strings from &apos;./strings&apos; import images from &apos;./images&apos; import colors from &apos;./colors&apos; import palette from &apos;./palette&apos; const R = { strings, images, colors, palette } export default RAnd access it in the screen: 12345678910111213import R from 'res/R'render() &#123; return ( &lt;SafeAreaView style=&#123;styles.container&#125;&gt; &lt;Image style=&#123;styles.logo&#125; source=&#123;R.images.logo&#125; /&gt; &lt;Image style=&#123;styles.image&#125; source=&#123;R.images.placeholder&#125; /&gt; &lt;Text style=&#123;styles.title&#125;&gt;&#123;R.strings.onboarding.welcome.title.toUpperCase()&#125;&lt;/Text&gt; )&#125; Replace strings with R.strings, colors with R.colors, and images with R.images. With the R annotation, it is clear that we are accessing static assets from the app bundle. This also matches the Airbnb convention for singleton, as our R is now like a global constant. 23.8 Use PascalCase when you export a constructor / class / singleton / function library / bare object. const AirbnbStyleGuide = { es6: { }, } export default AirbnbStyleGuideWhere to go from hereIn this post, I’ve shown you how I think you should structure folders and files in a React Native project. We’ve also learned how to manage resources and access them in a safer manner. I hope you’ve found it useful.

Luckily all the videos are available on Apple Developer site very shortly, and we can watch them now on Chrome or the unofficial WWDC app on macOS. I recommend the WWDC macOS app as it allows to mark favourites and filter, also offers the ability to adjust play speed to 1.25 or 1.5 saves me some time watching. This year WWDC focuses a lot on privacy, stability, and speed, which are all I wish, so many thanks to Apple engineers who made that happen, and the resit to install the so called more stable iOS 12 is real. As an iOS engineers, I like to focus more about the necessary things to me, that is about the Swift programming language, new changes in Cocoa Touch, enhancements in Xcode and testing tricks. I also like to explore more about machine learning so I’m very glad that Apple is investing more into this technology with the introduction of Turi Create and Create ML. To me, APIs come and get deprecated very often and it’s good to know them, but the most important thing is to invest in your programming, debugging and testing skill which you can apply in many other platforms. Continued from last year favourites list, below are my favourite sessions with personal notes. Things are listed in no particular order. Hope you find it useful. Platforms State of the UnionIf you don’t have time, you should watch only this session. Platform State of the Union is like keynote for developers as it highlights important changes. Privacy: Apple confirms on its commitment in privacy and security, also introduces password management feature and auto fill on iOS 12. Generating strong password, integrating with 3rd password management and quickly populating OTP field from SMS message have never been easier. GateKeeper gets some improvements as well and begins to require app to be notarised. iOS 12: huge improvement in performance, Siri gets smarter with Shortcut support, group calling in FaceTime and grouped notification. Also for emoji fan, Memoji was introduced. macOS 10.14 Mojave: more with Dark Mode. They demo mostly with Xcode in dark mode, which looks so cool. This year WWDC banner give hints about iOS and macOS cross-platform apps, which is partially true with Marzipan, a way to allow iOS apps to run on the mac. Xcode 10: with improvements in code editing and source control changes bar indicator. Debugging with memory debug tool, LLDB performance enhancement and particular the new build system completely rewritten in Swift with parallel tasks are exciting news. Swift 4.2: if you follow swift repo then Swift 4.2 may not be very surprising. There are also announcements for Swift 5 plan. Machine Learning: is never hotter than this. This year we see huge investments in machine learning with Create ML, Turi Create, Natural Language frameworks, CoreML 2, new detection capabilities in Vision. ARKit 2, watchOS 5, tvOS 12, AppStore Connect and AppStore Connect APIs are some other important news you don’t want to miss. What’s new in Swift Together with this session, I recommend you to read What’s new in Swift 4.2 summary which is very succinct. Besides improvement in complication and runtime, Swift 4.2 offers some new features: iterable enum case, synthesised Equatable and Hashable, handy functions for shuffling, random generating. To me, the need to explicitly handle Implicitly unwrapped optional is also a reasonable change. What’s New in Cocoa Touch This is a brief introduction to all changes coming to iOS 12, together with tips on how to be a good iOS citizen. Learn what can affect scrolling experience and prefetching technique, memory consumption and automatic backing stores, how to get the best from UIImage and UIImageView . AutoLayout engine got a lot of performance improvement so it won’t bother you any more. To me the most satisfying is to get all the UIKit notifications and classes reorganised under nested types, which makes code reasoning very easy. Getting the Most out of Playgrounds in Xcode I’ve written about Playground before and I’m very glad that Apple also invests a lot in it. The way people can interact and train model [Create ML](http://Introducing Create ML) in Playground is mesmerising. People may question how Playground works so well in session’s demos, but we can’t resist the new changes coming to Playground like Step by Step execution, markup rendering improvements and also how easy it is to consume custom frameworks. We can also now publish our own Playground through subscription. What’s New in Core ML Apple starts the machine learning trend last year with the introduction of Core ML. We might be excited and frustrated at the same time as Core ML is powerful but there’s no way we can customise it. Now the 2 parts tell us how to implement custom layer and model, techniques to reduce model size like quantisation and flexible model. This makes the foundation for improvement in Vision in object tracking and the debut of Natural Language framework. Machine learning has never been easier. What’s New in TestingI can’t miss any testing sessions as it is part of every day’s work. How can your program avoids regression bugs and ready for refactoring without any tests? This session shows improvement in coverage and the introduction of xccov tool to help us build automation on top of coverage report. Parallel distributed testing in Xcode 10 can save us some time to have coffee. Another wonderful news is that tests have multiple order execution mode to avoid bugs due to implicit dependencies. Testing Tips &amp; Tricks 🌟 This is my most favourite. The session starts with a pyramid of tests with unit integration and end-to-end test analogy explanation, then to some very cool tips and tricks. Testing network request: I like the separation of APIRequest and APIRequestLoader with URLSession , dependency injection with default parameter and the customisation of URLProtocol in URLSessionConfiguration Testing notification: Notification is system wide and I try to avoid it as much as possible. This shows how to inject dependency with default parameter and use of own NotificationCenter instead of NotificationCenter.default to ease testing Testing location: build abstraction with LocationProvider and LocationFetcher . How to use custom protocol and protocol for delegate to mock during test Testing timer: how to use and mock RunLoop behaviour with Timer Advanced Debugging with Xcode and LLDB LLDB has been improved to enable to debugging reliability experience, issues with AST context corruption, Swift type resolution are now things in the past. We can review how to use some common LLDB commands with handy arguments, and how to use Xcode breakpoint to its best. A Tour of UICollectionView 🌟 I begin to use UICollectionView more than UITableView , and it also has same code as NSCollectionView,which is more comfortable solution than the horrible NSTableView . Item size in UICollectionViewLayout : I often rely on UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout to specify item size but after watching this session, I feel like moving size related code to Layout object feels more like a good way to go Mosaic layout: This is not new, but good to watch again. You learn how to implement custom layout using cached layout attributes Data Source update: I didn’t expect Apple mentions this, but it is a good lesson on how UICollectionView handles batch update. I ‘ve written about this before in my A better way to update UICollectionView data in Swift with diff framework and that post gets a lot of attractions. In this session we need to remember that *ordering matters in data source update, but not in collection view update *❗️❗️❗️ Swift Generics Generic was a core feature of Swift since the beginning, we all know that it helps us to implement generic code that can work with many types in a type safe manner. This session reminds that I ‘ve never learned enough, especially the reasonable design behind it. The sessions showcases Collection protocol and its protocol inheritances: MutableCollection , BidirectionalCollection , RandomAccessCollection and how they can be combined to provide generic functionalities for conformers. The associatedtype requirement in each protocol, especially Index and Element, is very minimal and has enough constraints for the protocol to implement lots of necessary functionalities in its protocol extension, which is eye opening for me. I very like to read open source, so looking at the source code for such protocols helps me understand more. The part about Fisher Yates shuffle algorithm details how we can come up with necessary protocol while still make them generic Pay attention to when they mention count and map , you can learn more how each concrete type can hook into the customisation point in protocol extension Finally learn the Liskov substitution principle with protocol in class inheritance. You should also Using Collections Effectively for how to utilise handy functions in Collection. Data You Can Trust Although Codable has a lot to offers in term of data integrity, this is good to know about to make sure the data you receive is actually the right data in correct format and structure. CommonCrypto is also part of new iOS SDK so you don’t need my Arcane library to handle encryption and hashing in your apps. Embracing Algorithms This is the most pleasant to watch as it is like a conversation between the speaker and the imaginary manager Crusty. Here I learn how to be aware of algorithm complexity and also how to utilise built in Foundation functions which are already optimised for performance. After this session I can’t help myself but going to Swift repo to read the Algorithms.swift file immediately. Image and Graphics Best Practices Learn how image encoding and decoding works through data and image buffer and how that affects memory and performance. There are techniques like downsampling that can tackle this problem. This also recommends against using backing store, and instead, use UIImageView A Guide to Turi Create I’ve written about Turi Create before, but it is just scratching the surface of the many tasks offered by Turi. This year Apple releases Turi Create 5 with style transfer task, Vision Feature Print, GPU acceleration and recommender model improvements. I can’t wait to explore. And if you take a look at MLDataTable in Create ML framework, it looks like this has Turi ‘s SFrame under the hood. That’s it. Thanks for reading. What are your favourite sessions this year?

It’s easy to get unpublished software notarized with the Export process or xcodebuild. Custom build workflows are supported by the xcrun altool command line tool for uploading, and you can use xcrun stapler to attach the ticket to the package. Published Software. To submit software you’ve already published, upload it using the xcrun altool command line tool. Several file types are supported, including .zip, .pkg, and .dmg, so you can upload the same package you already distribute to users. Notarizing Your App Before Distributionhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution When you click Next, Xcode uploads your archive to the notary service. When the upload is complete, the notary service begins the scanning process, which usually takes less than an hour. While the notary service scans your software, you can continue to prepare your archive for distribution. For example, you can export the archive and perform any final testing that you require prior to making your software available to customers. When the notarization process finishes, Xcode downloads the ticket and staples it to your archive. At that point, export your archive again to receive a distributable version of your software that includes the notary ticket. Upload a macOS app to be notarizedhttps://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev88332a81e First, upload your macOS app to Apple to be notarized. If the upload fails, view the upload logs to find the problem. For example, you must enable hardened runtime (macOS) before you upload the app. Otherwise, check the notarization status and when the status is “Ready for distribution”, export the app for distribution. Distribute outside the Mac App Store (macOS)https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev033e997ca In some cases, you may want to distribute an app outside of the Mac App Store. Because the app won’t be distributed by Apple, assure users that you are a trusted developer by signing your app with a Developer ID certificate. Users gain additional assurance if your Developer ID-signed app is also notarized by Apple. On macOS, if your app isn’t downloaded from the Mac App Store or signed with a Developer ID certificate, it won’t launch unless the user completely disables Gatekeeper. Users have the option of enabling or disabling identified developers in System Preferences.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"macOS","slug":"macOS","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/macOS/"}]},{"title":"How to check file under Library in macOS","slug":"How-to-check-file-under-Library-in-macOS","date":"2019-04-10T18:54:10.000Z","updated":"2019-04-10T18:54:10.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/How-to-check-file-under-Library-in-macOS/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/How-to-check-file-under-Library-in-macOS/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #200 123let home = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(.applicationScriptsDirectory, .userDomainMask, true).first!let path = home.appending(\".XcodeWayExtensions/XcodeWayScript.scpt\")let exists = FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: path)","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"How to parse json in Go","slug":"How-to-parse-json-in-Go","date":"2019-04-09T06:29:22.000Z","updated":"2019-04-09T06:59:53.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/How-to-parse-json-in-Go/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/How-to-parse-json-in-Go/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #199 Unmarshal using encoding/json property in struct needs to be first letter capitalized 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233import ( \"net/http\" \"encoding/json\" \"io/ioutil\" \"fmt\")type MyJsonObject struct &#123; Id string `json:\"id\"` Name string `json:\"name\"`&#125;type MyJsonArray struct &#123; Data []MyJsonObject `json:\"data\"`&#125;func FetchJson() &#123; url := \"https://myapp.com/json\" client := http.Client&#123; Timeout: time.Second * 10 &#125; request, requestError := http.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, url, nil) request.Header.Set(\"User-Agent\", \"myapp\") response, responseError := client.Do(request) body, readError := ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body) fmt.Println(requestError, responseError, readError) myJsonArray := MyJsonArray&#123;&#125; marshalError := json.Unmarshal(body, &amp;myJsonArray) fmt.Println(jsonResponse, marshalError) &#125; MapAnd how to map to another structhttps://gobyexample.com/collection-functions 123456789101112131415161718func Map(vs []JsonStop, f func(JsonStop) *api.Stop) []*api.Stop &#123; vsm := make([]*api.Stop, len(vs)) for i, v := range vs &#123; vsm[i] = f(v) &#125; return vsm&#125;stops := Map(jsonResponse.Data, func(jsonStop JsonStop) *api.Stop &#123; stop := api.Stop&#123; Id: jsonStop.Id, Name: jsonStop.Name, Address: jsonStop.Address, Lat: jsonStop.Lat, Long: jsonStop.Long&#125; return &amp;stop &#125;) json to protobuf Use https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/protobuf/jsonpb","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"How to resolve deep json object in Dart","slug":"How-to-resolve-deep-json-object-in-Dart","date":"2019-04-08T19:50:13.000Z","updated":"2019-09-09T06:29:37.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/How-to-resolve-deep-json-object-in-Dart/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/How-to-resolve-deep-json-object-in-Dart/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #198 If we are not on the edge with GRPC and Protocol Buffer, then most likely we are going to deal with Restful and JSON.

Here is a bit of my reflections on curry and how to apply it in Javascript and Swift. Taking one parameter in HaskellIn Haskell, all function officially takes only 1 parameter. Function with many parameters are just curried, which means they will be partially applied. Calling sum 1 just returns a function with 1 parameter, then 2is passed into this function. The following 2 function calls are the same. ghci&gt; sum 1 2 3 ghci&gt; (max 1) 2 3I tend to think of curried function or partially applied function as something that carry dependencies at each application step. Each curried function can be assigned to variable or pass around, or as returned value. Curry in Swift for predicateWhen I was trying to make my own Signal library, I have and Event filterThen there should be a filter for Signal. The idea of filter is that we should update signal if the Event is Next with right filtered value public func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt;{ let signal = Signal&lt;T&gt;() subscribe { result in switch(result) { case let .Success(value): if f(value) { signal.update(result) } case let .Error(error): signal.update(.Error(error)) } } return signal }2 parametersBut having Event as another monad, I think it should be more encapsulated if that switching logic gets moved into the Event. Here the filter takes 2 params Event.swift func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool, callback: (Event&lt;T&gt; -&gt; Void)) { switch self { case let .Next(value) where f(value): callback(self) case .Failed: callback(self) default: break } }Signal.swift public func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt; { let signal = Signal&lt;T&gt;() subscribe { event in event.filter(f, callback: signal.update) } return signal }CurryingWith currying, we can make filter a more abstract function, and defer the decision to pass the callback param. It is a little carried away but I find it helpful this way Now filter accepts 1 param, and it returns a function that takes callback as its param Event.swift func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; ((Event&lt;T&gt; -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) { return { g in switch self { case let .Next(value) where f(value): g(self) case .Failed: g(self) default: break } } }Signal.swift public func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt; { let signal = Signal&lt;T&gt;() subscribe { event in event.filter(f)(signal.update) } return signal }Curry syntax in Swift 2 and aboveSwift 2 supports curry syntax function func sum(a: Int)(b: Int) -&gt; Int { return a + b } let sumWith5 = sum(5) let result = sumWith5(b: 10)Unfortunately, the syntactic sugar for declaring curry has been dropped since Swift 3. You may want to find out in Bidding farewell to currying. But it’s not a big deal as we can easily create curry function. It is just a function that returns another function. Using curry for partial application in UIKitI used this curry technique in my Xkcd app. See MainController.swift. MainController is vanilla UITabBarController with ComicsController and FavoriteController , all embedded in UINavigationViewController . The feature is that when a comic is selected, a comic detail screen should be pushed on top of the navigation stack. For example in ComicsController /// Called when a comic is selected var selectComic: ((Comic) -&gt; Void)?All ComicsController needs to know is to call that selectComic closure with the chosen Comic, and someone should know how to handle that selection. Back to the handleFlow function inside MainController. private func handleFlow() { typealias Function = (UINavigationController) -&gt; (Comic) -&gt; Void let selectComic: Function = { [weak self] navigationController in return { (comic: Comic) in guard let self = self else { return } let detailController = self.makeDetail(comic: comic) navigationController.pushViewController(detailController, animated: true) } } comicsController.selectComic = selectComic(comicNavigationController) favoriteController.selectComic = selectComic(favoriteNavigationController) }I declared Function as typealias to explicitly state the curry function that we are going to build typealias Function = (UINavigationController) -&gt; (Comic) -&gt; VoidWe build selectComic as curried function, that takes UINavigationViewController and returns a function that takes Comic and returns Void . This way when we partially apply selectComic with the a navigationController , we get another function that has navigationController as dependency, and ready to be assigned to selectComic property in comicsController . Curry promised function in JavascriptI like to work with Promise and async/await in Javascript. It allows chainable style and easy to reason about. So when working with callbacks in Javascript, for example callback from native modules in React Native, I tend to convert them into Promise. For example when working with HealthKit, we need to expose a native modules around it // [@flow](http://twitter.com/flow) import { NativeModules } from &apos;react-native&apos; type HealthManagerType = { checkAuthorisation: ((string) =&gt; void)) =&gt; void, authorise: ((boolean) =&gt; void)) =&gt; void, readWorkout: (Date, Date, () =&gt; void)) =&gt; void, readDailySummary: (Date, Date, () =&gt; void)) =&gt; void, readMeasurement: (Date, Date, () =&gt; void)) =&gt; void } const HealthManager: HealthManagerType = NativeModules.HealthManager export default HealthManagerWe can build a toPromise function that can convert a function with callback into Promise // [@flow](http://twitter.com/flow) const toPromise = (f: (any) =&gt; void) =&gt; { return new Promise&lt;any&gt;((resolve, reject) =&gt; { try { f((result) =&gt; { resolve(result) }) } catch (e) { reject(e) } }) } export default toPromiseHowever, as you can see in the signature, it only works with a callback of type (any) =&gt; void In other words, this callback must have exactly 1 parameter, because a Promise can either returns a value or throws an error. To remedy this, we can build a curry function that can turns function with either 1, 2, 3 parameters into curried function. Thanks to the dynamic nature of Javascript, we have // [@flow](http://twitter.com/flow) function curry0(f: () =&gt; void) { return f() } function curry1(f: (any) =&gt; void) { return (p1: any) =&gt; { return f(p1) } } function curry2(f: (any, any) =&gt; void) { return (p1: any) =&gt; { return (p2: any) =&gt; { return f(p1, p2) } } } function curry3(f: (any, any, any) =&gt; void) { return (p1: any) =&gt; { return (p2: any) =&gt; { return (p3: any) =&gt; { return f(p1, p2, p3) } } } } export default { curry0, curry1, curry2, curry3 }So with a function that have 3 parameters, we can use curry3 to partially apply the first 2 parameters. Then we have a function that accepts just a callback, and this is turned into Promise via toPromise const readWorkout = curry.curry3(HealthManager.readWorkout)(DateUtils.startDate))(DateUtils.endDate)) const workouts = await toPromise(readWorkout)Where to go from hereHere are some of my favorite posts to read more about curry Higher order functions Introduction to Function Currying in Swift Swift Function Currying Currying in JavaScript: I like how he uses memory and slice to gradually build more generic curry function","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"swift","slug":"swift","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/swift/"},{"name":"javascript","slug":"javascript","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/javascript/"}]},{"title":"How to fix SSLPeerUnverifiedException in Android","slug":"How-to-fix-SSLPeerUnverifiedException-in-Android","date":"2019-03-24T20:00:49.000Z","updated":"2019-03-24T20:04:29.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/How-to-fix-SSLPeerUnverifiedException-in-Android/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/How-to-fix-SSLPeerUnverifiedException-in-Android/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #184 Get error javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: No peer certificate in Android API 16 to API 19 Getting startedRead about HTTPS and SSL https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-sslCheck backend TLS https://www.ssllabs.com/index.htmlTLS by default in Android P https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/protecting-users-with-tls-by-default-in.html TLS versionRead https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLSocket.html This class extends Sockets and provides secure socket using protocols such as the “Secure Sockets Layer” (SSL) or IETF “Transport Layer Security” (TLS) protocols.

Install TLS 1.2 when neededRead https://medium.com/tech-quizlet/working-with-tls-1-2-on-android-4-4-and-lower-f4f5205629a The first thing we realized was that despite documentation suggesting otherwise, not all devices on Android 4.1+ actually support TLS 1.2. Even though it is likely due to device manufacturers not fully following the official Android specs, we had to do what we could to ensure this would work for our users. Luckily, Google Play Services provides a way to do this. The solution is to use ProviderInstaller from Google Play Services to try to update the device to support the latest and greatest security protocols. 1234567891011fun Context.installTls12() &#123; try &#123; ProviderInstaller.installIfNeeded(this) &#125; catch (e: GooglePlayServicesRepairableException) &#123; // Prompt the user to install/update/enable Google Play services.

Then use 12String url = \"https://www.myserver.com/data\"new MyHttpRequestTask().execute(url); Use custom SSLSocketFactory in some networking librariesIf our custom MyFactory works for HttpsUrlConnection, then the problem lies in some 3rd party networking libraries. Read https://blog.dev-area.net/2015/08/13/android-4-1-enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2/ The Android documentation for SSLSocket says that TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 is supported within android starting API level 16+ (Android 4.1, Jelly Bean). But it is by default disabled but starting with API level 20+ (Android 4.4 for watch, Kitkat Watch and Android 5.0 for phone, Lollipop) they are enabled. But it is very hard to find any documentation about how to enable it for phones running 4.1 for example. The first thing you need to do is to make sure that your minimum required API level is 16 to have the following code working in your project. To enable TLS 1.1 and 1.2 you need to create a custom SSLSocketFactory that is going to proxy all calls to a default SSLSocketFactory implementation. In addition to that do we have to override all createSocket methods and callsetEnabledProtocols on the returned SSLSocket to enable TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2. For an example implementation just follow the link below. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;class MyFactory extends org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory &#123; public static KeyStore getKeyStore() &#123; KeyStore trustStore = null; try &#123; trustStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType()); trustStore.load(null, null); &#125; catch (Throwable t) &#123; t.printStackTrace(); &#125; return trustStore; &#125; private SSLSocketFactory internalSSLSocketFactory; public MyFactory(KeyStore truststore) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, KeyManagementException, KeyStoreException, UnrecoverableKeyException &#123; super(truststore); SSLContext context = SSLContext.getInstance(\"TLS\"); context.init(null, null, null); internalSSLSocketFactory = context.getSocketFactory(); &#125; @Override public Socket createSocket() throws IOException &#123; return enableTLSOnSocket(internalSSLSocketFactory.createSocket()); &#125; @Override public Socket createSocket(Socket socket, String host, int port, boolean autoClose) throws IOException, UnknownHostException &#123; return enableTLSOnSocket(internalSSLSocketFactory.createSocket(socket, host, port, autoClose)); &#125; private Socket enableTLSOnSocket(Socket socket) &#123; if(socket != null &amp;&amp; (socket instanceof SSLSocket)) &#123; ((SSLSocket)socket).setEnabledProtocols(new String[] &#123;\"TLSv1.1\", \"TLSv1.2\"&#125;); &#125; return socket; &#125;&#125; Then maybe use it in a library, for example the ancient AsyncHttpClient 123asyncHttpClient = new AsyncHttpClient();asyncHttpClient.setTimeout(HTTP_GET_TIMEOUT);asyncHttpClient.setSSLSocketFactory(new MyFactory(MyFactory.getKeyStore()));","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"How to zoom in double in MapKit","slug":"How-to-zoom-in-double-in-MapKit","date":"2019-03-22T10:10:38.000Z","updated":"2019-03-22T10:10:38.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/How-to-zoom-in-double-in-MapKit/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/How-to-zoom-in-double-in-MapKit/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #183 123456789101112func zoomInDouble(coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D) &#123; let region = mapView.region let zoomInRegion = MKCoordinateRegion( center: coordinate, span: MKCoordinateSpan( latitudeDelta: region.span.latitudeDelta * 0.5, longitudeDelta: region.span.longitudeDelta * 0.5 ) ) mapView.setRegion(zoomInRegion, animated: true)&#125;","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"How to select cluster annotation in MapKit","slug":"How-to-select-cluster-annotation-in-MapKit","date":"2019-03-22T10:09:56.000Z","updated":"2019-03-22T10:09:56.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/How-to-select-cluster-annotation-in-MapKit/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/How-to-select-cluster-annotation-in-MapKit/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #182 123456789func mapView(_ mapView: MKMapView, didSelect view: MKAnnotationView) &#123; guard let coordinate = view.annotation?.coordinate else &#123; return &#125; if (view.annotation is MKClusterAnnotation) &#123; zoomInDouble(coordinate: coordinate) &#125;&#125;","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"How to cluster annotations in MapKit in iOS 11","slug":"How-to-cluster-annotations-in-MapKit-in-iOS-11","date":"2019-03-22T10:09:01.000Z","updated":"2019-03-22T10:24:27.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/How-to-cluster-annotations-in-MapKit-in-iOS-11/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/How-to-cluster-annotations-in-MapKit-in-iOS-11/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #181 https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkannotationview/decluttering_a_map_with_mapkit_annotation_clustering 1234567891011final class AnnotationView: MKMarkerAnnotationView &#123; override init(annotation: MKAnnotation?, reuseIdentifier: String?) &#123; super.init(annotation: annotation, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier) clusteringIdentifier = String(describing: ClusterView.self) &#125; required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) &#123; fatalError() &#125;&#125; 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940final class ClusterView: MKAnnotationView &#123; override init(annotation: MKAnnotation?, reuseIdentifier: String?) &#123; super.init(annotation: annotation, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier) displayPriority = .defaultHigh &#125; required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) &#123; fatalError() &#125; override func prepareForDisplay() &#123; super.prepareForDisplay() guard let annotation = annotation as?

To avoid retain cycle you often see the weakSelf - strongSelf dance like this 123456__weak __typeof__(self) weakSelf = self; self.block = ^&#123; __typeof__(self) strongSelf = weakSelf; [strongSelf doSomething]; [strongSelf doSomethingElse]; &#125;; When block is createdBlock is object when it is copiedBlocks are created on the stack and will go away when their stack frame returns. While on the stack, a block has no effect on the storage or lifetime of anything it accesses. If blocks need to exist after the stack frame returns, they can be copied to the heap and this action is an explicit operation. This way, a block will gain reference-counting as all objects in Cocoa. When they are copied, they take their captured scope with them, retaining any objects they refer Blocks can capture values from the enclosing scopeAs well as containing executable code, a block also has the ability to capture state from its enclosing scope. Note that block captures the variable along with its decorators (i.e. weak qualifier), =&gt; This explains why you need to declare self as __weak When block is executedWhen block is executed, it is possible for weakSelf to be non-nil for the first method (doSomething), but not for the second (doSomethingElse) You may think, at first, this is a trick to use self inside the block avoiding the retain cycle warning. This is not the case. The strong reference to self is created at block execution time while using self in the block is evaluated at block declaration time, thus retaining the object. For best practice, however, you should create a strong reference of your object using the weak one. This won’t create a retain cycle either as the strong pointer within the block will only exist until the block completes (it’s only scope is the block itself). =&gt; This explains why you need to declare another __strong self More explanationThis is my answer to reader Nikita As many people point out, “Blocks are created on the stack and will go away when their stack frame returns. While on the stack, a block has no effect on the storage or lifetime of anything it accesses.”Even if block (declared on the stack) increase reference count to all the object it accesses, this would be useless, because this block will be discard when function returns When block are copied (You see that people usually declare property (copy) for block), it will increase reference count to all the objects it accesses. Why? because block are mean to be executed at a later time, so it need to keep strong reference to all the object it access. Block can be executed MANY TIMES, so IT WON’T RELEASE self AFTER this ran. When you nil out the block, it will be dealloc, hence it will decrease the reference count to all the objects it access. AFNetworking nil out the block after it is called, so you don’t have to use weakself inside block http://www.fantageek.com/1376/afnetworking-gotcha-2/ So there are cases when you don’t have to use weakself inside blocka. Make sure the block is not copied, you simply declare and run itb.

If packets arrive too late then they are discarded. A jitter buffer may be mis-configured and be either too large or too small. ImpactIf a jitter buffer is too small then an excessive number of packets may be discarded, which can lead to call quality degradation. Lower settings cause less delay in the meeting, but meetings with lower settings are more susceptible to jitter effects caused by network congestion. Less data is buffered, increasing the likelihood that delayed or lost packets will produce a jitter effect in the media stream. If a jitter buffer is too large then the additional delay can lead to conversational difficulty. Higher settings are more effective at reducing jitter effects. With higher settings, more data is buffered, which allows more time for delayed packets to arrive at the client. However, higher settings also result in more delay (or latency) in the meeting. A user who is speaking will not be heard immediately by the other meeting participants. The delay in the meeting increases with the amount of time that data is held in the buffer. ResolutionA typical jitter buffer configuration is 30mS to 50mS in size. In the case of an adaptive jitter buffer then the maximum size may be set to 100-200mS. Note that if the jitter buffer size exceeds 100mS then the additional delay introduced can lead to conversational difficulty.

The packet size depends on many different variables, so there is no great answer for an “average” packet size – average depends on the environment. Just as an example, if you currently have VoIP running within a LAN and want to provision a new WAN so you can use VoIP to another site, knowing how big your VoIP packets are on the LAN won’t help. See below for a VoIP packet size calculation for a typical LAN, which will get you started. Packet sizeThe general formula for VoIP packet size is this 1Frame overhead + Encapsulation overhead + IP overhead + Voice payload. Let’s say the packet is going across our LAN, so right now the frame overhead is 18 Bytes, for Ethernet II. (This size would change later if the packet crosses a trunk with 802.1Q tagging or ISL encapsulation, or is destined for the WAN, where a different link layer framing will probably be in use.) EncapsulationEncapsulation overhead would include things like IPSec tunnels for security. Suppose we are not encapsulating this voice packet, so there is no overhead here. “IP overhead” has overhead occurring at layer 3 and above, so for SIP phones this means IP (20 Bytes), UDP (8 Bytes), and RTP (12 Bytes). This is a total of 40 Bytes of IP overhead. Lastly, you must calculate the size of the actual voice payload. Suppose we use the G.711 codec, which gives us a codec bandwidth of 64kbps. Also suppose our phones have a packetisation period of 20ms (meaning 20ms worth of voice goes into every packet). With these two numbers, we can figure out the size of the voice payload. Since one second of voice contains 64 kilobits of data (“64 kbps”), it is easy to calculate how many bits Find the amount of Bytes per payload: 1264000 bits * .02 seconds = 1280 bits of voice per payload 1280 bits / 8 bits per byte = 160 Bytes of voice per payload The total overhead is 58 Bytes (18 + 40)The total VoIP packet size is 218 Bytes (160 + 58 ) In the interest of full disclosure, it is easy to get a bit rate per second from here; just convert 218 Bytes into bits and multiply by the packetization rate (which is the inverse of your packetization period, in this case 50 packets per second). The bit rate for ONE stream of this voice is 87.2kbps… we hope the user isn’t just talking to himself, so double that for an actual phone conversation. There are lots of other little things, like VAD and various header compressions, that you may need to factor into these calculations as well. As you can see, any one of these many things being off will give you a different answer, so knowing how to go about the entire process is important.

The problem with cell and model actually is How to map the model to the cell Who will do this job? The cell, Controller or another Model Mapping object ? The ViewModel is actually who does this work, which is to transform the model to something the view can easily use “A table view data source is none of these things. It’s purely a layer between the table view and the model. The model defines lists of things, but the table view data source transform those lists into sections and rows. It also returns the actual table view cells, but that’s not what I’m focusing on here. The key is its role as a middle-tier data transformer.” Do we access the cell ‘s subviewsPaul on UITableViewCellBrent follows with another post explaining how cell ‘s subviews should not be accessed outside of the cell Data SourceClean table view codeThis article deals with Bridging the Gap Between Model Objects and Cells.“At some point we have to hand over the data we want to display into the view layer. Since we still want to maintain a clear separation between the model and the view, we often offload this task to the table view’s data source. This kind of code clutters the data source with specific knowledge about the design of the cell.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a link layer procotol, it is used for resolving network layer address (IP) into link layer address (MAC). When we want to send IP packet to another host (a computer in the same LAN, or the Gateway), we must know the destination IP address. In order for the packet to reach the destination, the destination IP address must be converted to the corresponding MAC address, so the transmission can be processed in the data link layer. To setup this mapping IP-MAC in the ARP table, we must first send ARP request as broadcast one to the LAN. In the happy case, the one with the IP in the ARP request will reply us with his MAC address. Unfortunately, ARP is a stateless protocol. This means we continue to accept ARP replies and overwrite the old ones, even they have not expired yet. Worse, ARP does not define any authentication method to check whether the replies come from the trusted one (the one we want to receive the replies). These offer chances for the attacker to perform ARP Spoofing. The theory behind ARP SpoofingFrom the machine in the LAN, the attacker associate his MAC address and IP address of the target host (usually the Gateway), so that any traffic sent to that target host will come to the attacker. Here the attacker can decide whether to modify the packet, send or not. There are 3 types of ARP Spoofing Spoof the host computer Spoof the Gateway Spoof both the host computer and the Gateway To see the ARP tableOpen Command line (Windows) or Terminal (Mac OSX), and type 1arp -a This will list the MAC address associated with a specific IP. Note that some mappings maybe wrong due to ARP Spoofing How to prevent against this ?To prevent spoofing our computer, we can use softwares (search for Anti Netcut, Anti ARP spoofing, …) or set the static ARP ourselves. In fact, those softwares are based on setting static ARP. This way we set the static mapping IP-MAC for a specific host (computer or Gateway), and the OS definitely ignores all ARP replies for that IP. Example of static ARP mapping associated with the Gateway, performed on the computer host 1192.168.1.1 B4-B3-62-7C-CE-55 Here 192.168.1.1 and B4-B3-62-7C-CE-55 are the Gateway’s IP and MAC address To prevent spoofing the Gateway, we must set static ARP on that Gateway. Go to the Gateway/Router interface, in its ARP setting, fill in the mapping IP-MAC for a specific host Look for that Gateway manual or the related guide on how to perform this. This is devices dependent-method, but the theory remains the same. Example of static ARP mapping associated with the computer host, performed on the Gateway 1192.168.1.2 64-70-02-B2-9B-E1 Here 192.168.1.2 and 64-70-02-B2-9B-E1 are the machine host ‘s IP and MAC address. The machine host can be any computer in the LAN How to set static ARPProposed that 192.168.1.1 The destination host ‘s IP B4-B3-62-7C-CE-55 The destination host ‘s MAC Local Area Connection Our network interface name Open Terminal (Mac OSX) To delete specific mapping 1sudo arp -d 192.168.1.1 To set specific mapping 1sudo arp -s 192.168.1.1 B4-B3-62-7C-CE-55 Reference http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"tech","slug":"tech","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/tech/"}]},{"title":"Make your own sliding menu on Android tutorial – Part 2","slug":"Make-your-own-sliding-menu-on-Android-tutorial-Part-2","date":"2018-02-27T11:08:13.000Z","updated":"2019-06-21T07:56:09.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/Make-your-own-sliding-menu-on-Android-tutorial-Part-2/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/Make-your-own-sliding-menu-on-Android-tutorial-Part-2/","excerpt":"Issue #152 This is the part 2 of the tutorial.

If you forget, here is the link to part 1. Link to Github In the first part, we learn about the idea, the structure of the project and how MainActivity uses the MainLayout. Now we learn how to actually implement the MainLayout DISPLAY MENU AND CONTENT VIEWFirst we have MainLayout as a subclass of LinearLayout 1public class MainLayout extends LinearLayout We then need declare the constructors 1234567public MainLayout(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) &#123; super(context, attrs); &#125; public MainLayout(Context context) &#123; super(context); &#125; and override some useful methods 1234567891011@Override protected void onAttachedToWindow() &#123; super.onAttachedToWindow(); // Get our 2 child View menu = this.getChildAt(0); content = this.getChildAt(1); // Initially hide the menu menu.setVisibility(View.GONE); &#125; onAttachedToWindow() is called when MainLayout is attached to window. At this point it has a Surface and will start drawing. Note that this function is guaranteed to be called before onDraw. Here we set child views to our view and content variable 12menu = this.getChildAt(0);content = this.getChildAt(1); and initially hide the menu. Note that View.GONE tells the view to not take up space in the layout 1menu.setVisibility(View.GONE); In onMeasure(), we compute menuRightMargin, this variable is the amount of right space the menu should not occupy. In this case, we want the menu to take up 90% amount of the screen width. onMeasure() is called to ask all children to measure themselves and compute the measurement of this layout based on the children 12345@Override protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) &#123; super.onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec); menuRightMargin = mainLayoutWidth * 10 / 100; &#125; Finally, we need to override onLayout(), this is called from layout when this view should assign a size and position to each of its children. This is where we position the menu and content view. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223@Override protected void onLayout(boolean changed, int left, int top, int right, int bottom) &#123; // True if MainLayout 's size and position has changed // If true, calculate child views size if(changed) &#123; // Note: LayoutParams are used by views to tell their parents how they want to be laid out // content View occupies the full height and width LayoutParams contentLayoutParams = (LayoutParams)content.getLayoutParams(); contentLayoutParams.height = this.getHeight(); contentLayoutParams.width = this.getWidth(); // menu View occupies the full height, but certain width LayoutParams menuLayoutParams = (LayoutParams)menu.getLayoutParams(); menuLayoutParams.height = this.getHeight(); menuLayoutParams.width = this.getWidth() - menuRightMargin; &#125; // Layout the child views menu.layout(left, top, right - menuRightMargin, bottom); content.layout(left + contentXOffset, top, right + contentXOffset, bottom); &#125; Note for the use of the contentXOffset variable. It is the content that is moving, not the menu. So contentXOffset is used to translate the content horizontally when it is moving ADDING ANIMATIONSo the main idea of sliding menu is to change contentXOffset and call offsetLeftAndRight for the content to move the content. But for the content ‘s new position to survive, we need to actually layout it on onLayout(), as shown in previous code snippet For more information, see Flyin menu using offsetLeftAndRight not preserving after a layout To better control sliding state, we declare MenuState enumeration 123456private enum MenuState &#123; HIDING, HIDDEN, SHOWING, SHOWN, &#125;; HIDDEN state is when menu is fully hidden, and SHOWN state is when menu is fully shown. HIDDING state is when menu is about to hide, and SHOWING state is when menu is about to show. Initially currentMenuState is set to HIDDEN so that the menu won’t show up on first launch. The main method of our MainLayout is toggleMenu, which, as it name implied, allow us to toggle menu 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627public void toggleMenu() &#123; // Do nothing if sliding is in progress if(currentMenuState == MenuState.HIDING || currentMenuState == MenuState.SHOWING) return; switch(currentMenuState) &#123; case HIDDEN: currentMenuState = MenuState.SHOWING; menu.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); menuScroller.startScroll(0, 0, menu.getLayoutParams().width, 0, SLIDING_DURATION); break; case SHOWN: currentMenuState = MenuState.HIDING; menuScroller.startScroll(contentXOffset, 0, -contentXOffset, 0, SLIDING_DURATION); break; default: break; &#125; // Begin querying menuHandler.postDelayed(menuRunnable, QUERY_INTERVAL); // Invalite this whole MainLayout, causing onLayout() to be called this.invalidate(); &#125; Here we use a Scroller to faciliate sliding animation. Note that Scroller does not perform any visual effect, it is just a base for us to track animation by querying the Scroller’s methods. Bills has a good answer on SO Android: Scroller Animation? The Scroller uses a custom Interpolator to make the sliding more natural. It moves faster in the end. The formula is here 1interpolator(t) = (t-1)5 + 1 If the menu is in HIDDEN state, we set its visibility to VISIBLE and start scrolling. Here the content is moving horizontally, so we scroll from left edge to menu width. Note that menu takes up only 90% of the screen width. If the menu is in SHOWN state, we start scrolling from the content ‘s current x position to the left edge. The 3rd parameter to the startScroll() method is the distance we want to scroll, a negative sign indicates that we want to scroll from right to left. You can tweak SLIDING_DURATION and QUERY_INTERVAL to your desire. SLIDING_DURATION is the duration of the scrolling. QUERY_INTERVAL is how often we perform querying the Scroller for information. I set it to 16ms so that we have an fps of about 60, which is too high :D Here the querying is achieved via calling adjustContentPosition() in MenuRunnable 12// Begin queryingmenuHandler.postDelayed(menuRunnable, QUERY_INTERVAL); 12345678// Query Scrollerprotected class MenuRunnable implements Runnable &#123; @Override public void run() &#123; boolean isScrolling = menuScroller.computeScrollOffset(); adjustContentPosition(isScrolling); &#125; &#125; Here we call computeScrollOffset to check if the scrolling is finished or not 12345678910111213141516171819private void adjustContentPosition(boolean isScrolling) &#123; int scrollerXOffset = menuScroller.getCurrX(); //Log.d(\"MainLayout.java adjustContentPosition()\", \"scrollerOffset \" + scrollerOffset); // Translate content View accordingly content.offsetLeftAndRight(scrollerXOffset - contentXOffset); contentXOffset = scrollerXOffset; // Invalite this whole MainLayout, causing onLayout() to be called this.invalidate(); // Check if animation is in progress if (isScrolling) menuHandler.postDelayed(menuRunnable, QUERY_INTERVAL); else this.onMenuSlidingComplete(); &#125; We base on getCurrX to update out contentXOffset and translate content view. Remember to call invalidate() everytime the content position is changed. We continue moving the content view until scrolling is finished Finally, in onMenuSlidingComplete(), we set the currentMenuState accordingly 12345678910111213private void onMenuSlidingComplete() &#123; switch (currentMenuState) &#123; case SHOWING: currentMenuState = MenuState.SHOWN; break; case HIDING: currentMenuState = MenuState.HIDDEN; menu.setVisibility(View.GONE); break; default: return; &#125; &#125; HANDLING GESTURETo support gesture, we first attach OnTouchListener to the content view. We do this in onMeasure() 123456content.setOnTouchListener(new OnTouchListener() &#123; @Override public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) &#123; return MainLayout.this.onContentTouch(v, event); &#125; &#125;); And in onContentTouch() we handle the ACTION_DOWN, ACTION_MOVE and ACTION_UP to allow dragging the content view Please note that we use getRawX() instead of getX() for consistent behavior. More information see PeyloW ‘s answer here How do I know if a MotionEvent is relative or absolute? Here I use curX and diffX to track previous position and how the difference in distance. When user is dragging, we continuously update the content view ‘s position. Please also prevent user from dragging beyond the left edge and right margin border When the user release his/her finger, we base on lastDiffX to decide if the menu should show or hide. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364656667686970717273747576777879808182838485868788899091public boolean onContentTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) &#123; // Do nothing if sliding is in progress if(currentMenuState == MenuState.HIDING || currentMenuState == MenuState.SHOWING) return false; // getRawX returns X touch point corresponding to screen // getX sometimes returns screen X, sometimes returns content View X int curX = (int)event.getRawX(); int diffX = 0; switch(event.getAction()) &#123; case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN: //Log.d(\"MainLayout.java onContentTouch()\", \"Down x \" + curX); prevX = curX; return true; case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE: //Log.d(\"MainLayout.java onContentTouch()\", \"Move x \" + curX); // Set menu to Visible when user start dragging the content View if(!isDragging) &#123; isDragging = true; menu.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); &#125; // How far we have moved since the last position diffX = curX - prevX; // Prevent user from dragging beyond border if(contentXOffset + diffX &lt;= 0) &#123; // Don't allow dragging beyond left border // Use diffX will make content cross the border, so only translate by -contentXOffset diffX = -contentXOffset; &#125; else if(contentXOffset + diffX &gt; mainLayoutWidth - menuRightMargin) &#123; // Don't allow dragging beyond menu width diffX = mainLayoutWidth - menuRightMargin - contentXOffset; &#125; // Translate content View accordingly content.offsetLeftAndRight(diffX); contentXOffset += diffX; // Invalite this whole MainLayout, causing onLayout() to be called this.invalidate(); prevX = curX; lastDiffX = diffX; return true; case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP: //Log.d(\"MainLayout.java onContentTouch()\", \"Up x \" + curX); Log.d(\"MainLayout.java onContentTouch()\", \"Up lastDiffX \" + lastDiffX); // Start scrolling // Remember that when content has a chance to cross left border, lastDiffX is set to 0 if(lastDiffX &gt; 0) &#123; // User wants to show menu currentMenuState = MenuState.SHOWING; // No need to set to Visible, because we have set to Visible in ACTION_MOVE //menu.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); //Log.d(\"MainLayout.java onContentTouch()\", \"Up contentXOffset \" + contentXOffset); // Start scrolling from contentXOffset menuScroller.startScroll(contentXOffset, 0, menu.getLayoutParams().width - contentXOffset, 0, SLIDING_DURATION); &#125; else if(lastDiffX &lt; 0) &#123; // User wants to hide menu currentMenuState = MenuState.HIDING; menuScroller.startScroll(contentXOffset, 0, -contentXOffset, 0, SLIDING_DURATION); &#125; // Begin querying menuHandler.postDelayed(menuRunnable, QUERY_INTERVAL); // Invalite this whole MainLayout, causing onLayout() to be called this.invalidate(); // Done dragging isDragging = false; prevX = 0; lastDiffX = 0; return true; default: break; &#125; return false; &#125;","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"android","slug":"android","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/android/"}]},{"title":"Make your own sliding menu on Android tutorial - Part 1","slug":"Make-your-own-sliding-menu-on-Android-tutorial-Part-1","date":"2018-02-27T11:07:48.000Z","updated":"2019-06-21T07:55:59.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/Make-your-own-sliding-menu-on-Android-tutorial-Part-1/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/Make-your-own-sliding-menu-on-Android-tutorial-Part-1/","excerpt":"Issue #151 This post was from long time ago when I did Android I can’t deny that Facebook is so amazing, they made trends and people want to follow.

User will then be able to get the menu by touching the Menu button, or just by dragging. The menu contains a list of Android UI controls and when selected, the main content view will shows the according screen. The source code is available on Github THE IDEAA sliding menu app typically has 2 views : the menu view (the green rectangle) and the content view (the red rectangle) We have many ways to implement the sliding effect, all depend on your intention Let the menu view hold still, while moving the content view. The content view usually sits on top of the menu view and cover the entire screen Opposite of 1. Let the content view hold still, while moving the menu view. The menu usually sits on top of the content view and occupy some amount of space, so that user can touch and drag it The same as 2. but when the menu is moving, the content is moving, too. When the menu is shown, we should disable interacting with the content view. The 1st solution is what we will do in this tutorial. It’s much the same with Facebook sliding menu OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECTFor better understanding, you should take a look at the project to see how things are organized /src/com.entropy.slidingmenu2 MainActivity.java : this should be your first screen. It contains the MainLayout and handle ListView click event to display the right content /src/com.entropy.slidingmenu2.fragment FragmentMain.java : the default content view FragmentButton.java : show one button on the content view The content view is really simple since it’s just for demo. I use Fragment so we can easily change the content view according to the ListView item selected /src/com.entropy.slidingmenu2.layout MainLayout.java : the most important part of this tutorial. For ease and reusability, it’s best to create a custom LinearLayout. This will be used to position the menu and content views appropriately and handle sliding effect /res/layout activity.main: represent the visual structure for MainLayout fragment_main: represent the content view THE PREPARATIONI list here the required knowledge just for reference Fragment : used to show the content view Support library : we use v4 in this tutorial to support Fragment for older devices Custom layout : our MainLayout is a custom layout Scroller : to facilitate the sliding animation Gesture : to allow drag and drop Without further ado, let’s get started DESIGNING activity_main.xmlThe activity_main.xml represents the content of our custom layout. Since its a custom layout, we must declare like this 123&lt;com.entropy.slidingmenu2.layout.MainLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" android:layout_width=\"match_parent\" android:layout_height=\"match_parent\" &gt; Inside it are the 2 LinearLayout. Both are declared with attributes but the final display will be decided by the code :) 12android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"android:layout_height=\"match_parent\" The first is for the menu, which holds a ListView The second is for the content, which holds the simulated action bar ^^ and the FrameLayout. The FrameLayout is where fragments will show up WORKING WITH MainActivity.javaThe MainActivity is the default activity, it contains our MainLayout and handle menu item selection In the onCreate() method, we do the following Inflate the MainLayout and its as the contentView for our activity 12mainLayout = (MainLayout)this.getLayoutInflater().inflate(R.layout.activity_main, null);setContentView(mainLayout); Init the ListView for the menu 1234567891011lvMenuItems = getResources().getStringArray(R.array.menu_items); lvMenu = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.activity_main_menu_listview); lvMenu.setAdapter(new ArrayAdapter(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, lvMenuItems)); lvMenu.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() &#123; @Override public void onItemClick(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; parent, View view, int position, long id) &#123; onMenuItemClick(parent, view, position, id); &#125; &#125;); Init the menu button 12345678btMenu = (Button) findViewById(R.id.activity_main_content_button_menu); btMenu.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() &#123; @Override public void onClick(View v) &#123; // Show/hide the menu toggleMenu(v); &#125; &#125;); Display FragmentMain as the initial Fragment for our content view 123456FragmentManager fm = MainActivity.this.getSupportFragmentManager();FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();FragmentMain fragment = new FragmentMain();ft.add(R.id.activity_main_content_fragment, fragment);ft.commit(); The toggleMenu() is a utility method to toggle the menu, it will calls MainLayout ‘s toggleMenu() method. We ‘ll talk about this later onMenuItemClick() is used to handle menu item selection. What it does is to create the according Fragment and replace it with the current one Handle the Back button. If the menu is shown, we should hide it, or we can quit the app 123456789@Override public void onBackPressed() &#123; if (mainLayout.isMenuShown()) &#123; mainLayout.toggleMenu(); &#125; else &#123; super.onBackPressed(); &#125; &#125; Let’s continue to part 2","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"android","slug":"android","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/android/"}]},{"title":"Some interesting repositories","slug":"Some-interesting-repositories","date":"2018-02-15T12:48:02.000Z","updated":"2018-04-13T12:17:33.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/Some-interesting-repositories/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/Some-interesting-repositories/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #150 Cool https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer 🙄 https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode https://github.com/jackdclark/five https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Dealing with updated pod in BuddyBuild","slug":"Dealing-with-updated-pod-in-BuddyBuild","date":"2018-02-01T11:37:57.000Z","updated":"2018-02-01T11:37:57.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/Dealing-with-updated-pod-in-BuddyBuild/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/Dealing-with-updated-pod-in-BuddyBuild/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #149 We’re using BuddyBuild as our CI.

This goes true when it comes to abbreviations. I’ve had some debates about whether to use JSON or Json, URL or Url, HTTP or Http. I personally prefer camelCase, so I’m very happy to see that Kotlin is on my side. See Kotlin Style guide, I think this guide should be applied in other languages, such as Swift 😛 Sometimes there is more than one reasonable way to convert an English phrase into camel case, such as when acronyms or unusual constructs like “IPv6” or “iOS” are present. To improve predictability, use the following scheme. Beginning with the prose form of the name: Convert the phrase to plain ASCII and remove any apostrophes. For example, “Müller’s algorithm” might become “Muellers algorithm”. Divide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining punctuation (typically hyphens). Recommended: if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., “AdWords” becomes “ad words”). Note that a word such as “iOS” is not really in camel case per se; it defies any convention, so this recommendation does not apply. Now lowercase everything (including acronyms), then uppercase only the first character of: …each word, to yield pascal case, or …each word except the first, to yield camel case Finally, join all the words into a single identifier. Note that the casing of the original words is almost entirely disregarded. Prose form Correct Incorrect “XML Http Request” XmlHttpRequest XMLHTTPRequest “new customer ID” newCustomerId newCustomerID “inner stopwatch” innerStopwatch innerStopWatch “supports IPv6 on iOS” supportsIpv6OnIos supportsIPv6OnIOS “YouTube importer” YouTubeImporterYoutubeImporter* About iOS or IOS, I think I would go with IOS. I think React Native thinks so too NavigatorIOS looks and feels just like UINavigationController, because it is actually built on top of it.

Take a look at BarcodeScanner and the PR https://github.com/hyperoslo/BarcodeScanner/pull/82 When it is presented, we need a header view so that we can show a title and a close button. We can create a custom HeaderView that inherits from UIView or either embed it in a UINavigationController before presenting. If we go with the controller being embedded in UINavigationController approach, it will collide with the other UINavigationController when it is pushed. If we go with custom HeaderView, then we need to layout the view so that it looks good on both portrait and landscape, and on iPhone X that as safeAreaLayoutGuide. Using standalone UINavigationBarSince UINavigationController uses UINavigationBar under the hood, which uses UINavigationItem info to present the content. We can imitate this behavior by using a standalone UINavigationBar. See Adding Content to a Standalone Navigation Bar In the vast majority of scenarios you will use a navigation bar as part of a navigation controller. However, there are situations for which you might want to use the navigation bar UI and implement your own approach to content navigation. In these situations, you can use a standalone navigation bar. A navigation bar manages a stack of UINavigationItem objects The beauty is that our standalone UINavigationBar and that of UINavigationController are the same, use the same UINavigationItem and no manual layout are needed Declare UINavigationItemWe can just set properties like we did with a normal navigationItem 123let standaloneItem = UINavigationItem()standaloneItem.leftBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(customView: closeButton)standaloneItem.titleView = UILabel() Adding UINavigationBarCustomise your bar, then declare layout constraints. You only need to pin left, right, and top.

The thread is returned to the pool while the coroutine is waiting, and when the waiting is done, the coroutine resumes on a free thread in the pool. await() can not be called outside a coroutine, because it needs to suspend until the computation finishes, and only coroutines can suspend in a non-blocking way What does suspend function mean in Kotlin Coroutine 🤔https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47871868/what-does-suspend-function-mean-in-kotlin-coroutine I’m reading Kotlin Coroutine and know that it is based on suspend function. But what does suspend mean? Coroutine or function gets suspended? From https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html Basically, coroutines are computations that can be suspended without blocking a thread I heard people often say “suspend function”. But I think it is the coroutine who gets suspended because it is waiting for the function to finished? “suspend” usually means “cease operation”, in this case the coroutine is idle. Should we say the coroutine is suspended ? Which coroutine gets suspended? From https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html To continue the analogy, await() can be a suspending function (hence also callable from within an async {} block) that suspends a coroutine until some computation is done and returns its result: 123456async &#123; // Here I call it the outer async coroutine ... // Here I call computation the inner coroutine val result = computation.await() ...&#125; 🤔 It says “that suspends a coroutine until some computation is done”, but coroutine is like a lightweight thread. So if the coroutine is suspended, how can the computation is done ? We see await is called on computation, so it might be async that returns Deferred, which means it can start another coroutine 12345fun computation(): Deferred&lt;Boolean&gt; &#123; return async &#123; true &#125;&#125; 🤔 The quote say that suspends a coroutine. Does it mean suspend the outer async coroutine, or suspend the inner computation coroutine? Does suspend mean that while outer async coroutine is waiting (await) for the inner computation coroutine to finish, it (the outer async coroutine) idles (hence the name suspend) and returns thread to the thread pool, and when the child computation coroutine finishes, it (the outer async coroutine) wakes up, takes another thread from the pool and continues? The reason I mention the thread is because of https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/coroutines-basic-jvm.html The thread is returned to the pool while the coroutine is waiting, and when the waiting is done, the coroutine resumes on a free thread in the pool Understanding asyncFrom https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/coroutines-guide.md Conceptually, async is just like launch. It starts a separate coroutine which is a light-weight thread that works concurrently with all the other coroutines. The difference is that launch returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value, while async returns a Deferred – a light-weight non-blocking future that represents a promise to provide a result later. You can use .await() on a deferred value to get its eventual result, but Deferred is also a Job, so you can cancel it if needed. 12345678fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) = runBlocking&lt;Unit&gt; &#123; val time = measureTimeMillis &#123; val one = async &#123; doSomethingUsefulOne() &#125; val two = async &#123; doSomethingUsefulTwo() &#125; println(\"The answer is $&#123;one.await() + two.await()&#125;\") &#125; println(\"Completed in $time ms\")&#125; There is a laziness option to async using an optional start parameter with a value of CoroutineStart.LAZY. It starts coroutine only when its result is needed by some await or if a start function is invoked. Run the following example that differs from the previous one only by this option: 12345678fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) = runBlocking&lt;Unit&gt; &#123; val time = measureTimeMillis &#123; val one = async(start = CoroutineStart.LAZY) &#123; doSomethingUsefulOne() &#125; val two = async(start = CoroutineStart.LAZY) &#123; doSomethingUsefulTwo() &#125; println(\"The answer is $&#123;one.await() + two.await()&#125;\") &#125; println(\"Completed in $time ms\")&#125; What is the difference between launch/join and async/await in Kotlin coroutineshttps://stackoverflow.com/a/48079738/1418457 I find this guide https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/coroutines-guide.md to be useful. I will quote the essential parts 🦄 coroutine Essentially, coroutines are light-weight threads. So you can think of coroutine as something that manages thread in a very efficient way. 🐤 launch 12345678fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) &#123; launch &#123; // launch new coroutine in background and continue delay(1000L) // non-blocking delay for 1 second (default time unit is ms) println(\"World!\") // print after delay &#125; println(\"Hello,\") // main thread continues while coroutine is delayed Thread.sleep(2000L) // block main thread for 2 seconds to keep JVM alive&#125; So launch starts a background thread, does something, and returns a token immediately as Job. You can call join on this Job to block until this launch thread completes 12345678fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) = runBlocking&lt;Unit&gt; &#123; val job = launch &#123; // launch new coroutine and keep a reference to its Job delay(1000L) println(\"World!\") &#125; println(\"Hello,\") job.join() // wait until child coroutine completes&#125; 🦆 async Conceptually, async is just like launch. It starts a separate coroutine which is a light-weight thread that works concurrently with all the other coroutines. The difference is that launch returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value, while async returns a Deferred – a light-weight non-blocking future that represents a promise to provide a result later. So async starts a background thread, does something, and returns a token immediately as Deferred. 12345678fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) = runBlocking&lt;Unit&gt; &#123; val time = measureTimeMillis &#123; val one = async &#123; doSomethingUsefulOne() &#125; val two = async &#123; doSomethingUsefulTwo() &#125; println(\"The answer is $&#123;one.await() + two.await()&#125;\") &#125; println(\"Completed in $time ms\")&#125; You can use .await() on a deferred value to get its eventual result, but Deferred is also a Job, so you can cancel it if needed. So Deferred is actually a Job. See https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.experimental/-deferred/index.html 1interface Deferred&lt;out T&gt; : Job (source) 🦋 async is eager by default There is a laziness option to async using an optional start parameter with a value of CoroutineStart.LAZY. It starts coroutine only when its result is needed by some await or if a start function is invoked.

Swift allows you to represent real world objects that have some characteristics and can perform some action. I tend to think of an app as a world where each object is a person. They work and communicate. If a person can’t do the work alone, he needs to ask for help. Take a project, for example, if the manager has to do all of the work by himself, he will go crazy. So there is a need to organise and delegate tasks, and for many persons to collaborate on the project: designer, tester, scrum master, developer. After the task is done, the manager needs to be informed. This may not a good example. But at least you get the importance of communication and delegation in OOP. I was very intrigued by the word “architecture” when I started iOS programming. But after doing for a while, it all comes down to identifying and splitting responsibilities. This article tells a bit about MVC and simple Extract Classrefactoring to MVVM, and how to go further with Rx. You are free to create your own architecture, but whatever you do, consistence is key as to not confuse or surprise your teammates. Model View ControllerTake a look at the architecture you know the best, MVC, short for Model View Controller. You always get one when you create a new iOS project. View is where you present your data, using UIView, UIButton, UILabel. Model is just a fancy word for data. It can be your entity, data from networking, object from database, or from cache. The controller is the thing that mediates between the model and the view. UIViewController is the center of the universeThe problem with ViewController is that it tends to be huge. Apple puts it as the center of the universe, where it has lots of properties and responsibilities. There are many things that you can only do with a UIViewController. Things like interacting with storyboard, managing the view, configuring view rotation, state restoration. UIViewController is designed with lots of hooks for you to override and customize. Take a look at the many sections in UIViewController documentation, you can’t do the following without a UIViewController. func viewDidLoad() var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle { get } UITableViewDataSource var presentationController: UIPresentationController? { get } func childViewControllerForScreenEdgesDeferringSystemGestures() -&gt; UIViewController? func didMove(toParentViewController parent: UIViewController?) var systemMinimumLayoutMargins: NSDirectionalEdgeInsets var edgesForExtendedLayout: UIRectEdge var previewActionItems: [UIPreviewActionItem] var navigationItem: UINavigationItem var shouldAutorotate: BoolAs your app grows, we need to add more code for other logic. Such as networking, data source, handling multiple delegates, presenting child view controllers. We can, of course, put all the stuff on the view controller, but that results in big view controller and improvement in your scrolling skill. This is where you lose the big picture of responsibilities because all stuff stays in the mega view controller. You tend to introduce code duplication and bugs are hard to fix because they are all over the places. The same goes with Page in Windows Phone or Activity in Android. They are intended for a screen or partial screen of functionality. There are certain actions that can only be done through them like Page.OnNavigatedTo, Activity.onCreate. The buzzwords of architectureWhat do you do when the ViewController is doing a lot? You offset the work to other components. By the way, if you want another object to do the user input handling, you can use the Presenter. If the Presenter is doing too much, then it can offset the business logic to the Interactor. Also, there are more buzzwords that can be used. let buzzWords = [ &quot;Model&quot;, &quot;View&quot;, &quot;Controller&quot;, &quot;Entity&quot;, &quot;Router&quot;, &quot;Clean&quot;, &quot;Reactive&quot;, &quot;Presenter&quot;, &quot;Interactor&quot;, &quot;Megatron&quot;, &quot;Coordinator&quot;, &quot;Flow&quot;, &quot;Manager&quot; ] let architecture = buzzWords.shuffled().takeRandom() let acronym = architecture.makeAcronym() After all the buzzwords are assembled, we get an architecture. There are many of them, ranging from simple extract class refactoring, embracing MVC or taking inspiration from Clean Code, Rx, EventBus or Redux. The choice depends on project, and some teams prefer one architecture over the other. The pragmatic programmerPeople have different opinion about what is good architecture. For me, it is about clear separation of concern, good communication pattern and being comfortable to use. Each component in the architecture should be identifiable and have a specific role. The communication must be clear so that we know which object is talking to each other. This together with good dependency injection will make testing easier. Things that sound good in theory may not work well in practice. Separated domain objects are cool, protocol extensions are cool, multiple layers of abstraction are cool. But too many of them can be a problem. If you read enough about design patterns, you know they all come down to these simple principles: Encapsulate what varies: identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. Program to an interface, not an implementation Prefer composition over inheritance If there’s one thing we should master, it’s composition. The key is to identify responsibility and compose them in a reasonable and consistent way. Consult with your team mates on what suits the most. Always writing code with the thought that you will also be the future maintainer. Then you will write it differently. Don’t fight against the systemSome architectures introduce completely new paradigm. Some of them are cumbersome that there people write scripts to generate boiler plate code. It’s good that there are many approaches to a problem. But for me sometimes it feels they are fighting the system. Some tasks are made easy while some trivial tasks become extremely hard. We should not constrain ourselves to one architecture simply because it are trendy. Be pragmatic, not dogmatic. In iOS, we should embrace MVC. UIViewController is not meant for a full screen of content. They can contain and be composed to split the functionalities. We can use Coordinator and FlowController to manage dependencies and handle flow. Containerfor state transition, embedded logic controller, part of full screen content. This embracing ViewController approach play nicely with MVC in iOS and is my preferable way of doing. Model View ViewModel Another good-enough way is to offload some of the tasks to another object, let’s call it ViewModel. The name does not matter, you can name it Reactor, Maestro, Dinosaur. The important thing is your team get an agreed name. ViewModel takes some tasks from the ViewController and reports when it’s done. There are communication patterns in Cocoa Touch such as delegate, closures to use. ViewModel is self-contained, has no reference to UIKit, and has just input and output. We can put a lot of things into ViewModel like calculation, formatting, networking, business logic. Also, if you don’t like the ViewModel to become massive, you surely need to create some dedicated objects. ViewModel is the first step to get a slim ViewController. SynchronouslyBelow is a very simple ViewModel, which formats data based on User model. This is done synchronously. class ProfileController: UIViewController { override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() let viewModel = ViewModel(user: user) nameLabel.text = viewModel.name birthdayLabel.text = viewModel.birthdayString salaryLabel.text = viewModel.salary piLabel.text = viewModel.millionthDigitOfPi } }AsynchronouslyWe work with asynchronous API all the time. What if we want to show the user’s number of Facebook friends? For this to work we need to call Facebook API and this operation takes time. The ViewModel can report back via closure. viewModel.getFacebookFriends { friends in self.friendCountLabel.text = &quot;\\(friends.count)&quot; }Internally, the ViewModel may offload the task to a dedicated Facebook API client object. class ViewModel { func getFacebookFriends(completion: [User] -&gt; Void) { let client = APIClient() client.getFacebookFriends(for: user) { friends in DispatchQueue.main.async { completion(friends) } } } }Jetpack in Android Google introduced Android Architecture Component, now part of Jetpack, at Google IO 2017. It has ViewModel and LiveData, which is also a type of MVVM applied in Android. ViewModel survives through configuration changes, and notify results in terms of LiveData for Activity to consume. class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() { override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?, persistentState: PersistableBundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState, persistentState) val model = ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(MyViewModel::class.java) model.getUsers().observe(this, { users -&gt; // update UI }) } }This is one of the reason I like ViewModel. If we follow ViewModel like this, then code structures between iOS and Android become similar. There should be no need for some random Javascript cross platform solutions. You learn the concept once, and apply it on both iOS and Android. I learn ViewModel, RxSwift on iOS and feel right at home when I work with RxJava and RxBinding on Android. The Kickstarter project also proves that this works well in their iOS and Android apps. BindingTo encapsulate the closure, we can create a class called Binding, which can notify one or multiple listeners. It takes advantage of didSet, and the observable property becomes clear. class Binding&lt;T&gt; { var value: T { didSet { listener?(value) } } private var listener: ((T) -&gt; Void)? init(value: T) { self.value = value } func bind(_ closure: @escaping (T) -&gt; Void) { closure(value) listener = closure } }Here is how to use it inside ViewModel: class ViewModel { let friends = Binding&lt;[User]&gt;(value: []) init() { getFacebookFriends { friends.value = $0 } } func getFacebookFriends(completion: ([User]) -&gt; Void) { // Do the work } }When ever friends are fetched, or changed, the ViewController is updated accordingly. This is called reaction to changes. override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() viewModel.friends.bind { friends in self.friendsCountLabel.text = &quot;\\(friends.count)&quot; } }You often see MVVM introduction with reactive frameworks, and it is for a reason. They offer many chaining operators and make reactive programming easier and more declarative. RxSwiftPerhaps the most common reactive framework in Swift is RxSwift. The thing I like about it is that it follows ReactiveX pattern. So you will feel more familiar if you already use RxJava, RxJs, or RxKotlin. Observable RxSwift unifies sync and async operations through Observable. This is how you make one. class ViewModel { let friends: Observable&lt;[User]&gt; init() { let client = APIClient() friends = Observable&lt;[User]&gt;.create({ subscriber in client.getFacebookFriends(completion: { friends in subscriber.onNext(friends) subscriber.onCompleted() }) return Disposables.create() }) } }The power of RxSwift lies in its numerous operators, which help you chain Observables. Here you can call 2 network requests, wait for both of them to finish, then sum up the friends. This is very streamlined and saves you lots of time. Here you can just subscribe to the Observable, it will be triggered when the request completes: override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() viewModel.friends.subscribe(onNext: { friends in self.friendsCountLabel.text = &quot;\\(friends.count)&quot; }) }Input and outputOne thing that is nice about ViewModel and Rx is that we can separate input and output using Observable, which gives a clear interface. Read more at Learning from Open Source: Input and output container. Below it is clear that we fetch is an input, and friends is the viable output. class ViewModel { class Input { let fetch = PublishSubject&lt;()&gt;() } class Output { let friends: Driver&lt;[User]&gt; } let apiClient: APIClient let input: Input let output: Output init(apiClient: APIClient) { self.apiClient = apiClient // Connect input and output } } class ProfileViewController: BaseViewController&lt;ProfileView&gt; { let viewModel: ProfileViewModelType init(viewModel: ProfileViewModelType) { self.viewModel = viewModel } override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // Input viewModel.input.fetch.onNext(()) // Output viewModel.output.friends.subscribe(onNext: { friends in self.friendsCountLabel.text = &quot;\\(friends.count)&quot; }) } }How reactive worksIf you feel like Rx, it’s good to get an understanding of them after using some frameworks for a while. There are some concepts like Signal, SignalProducer, Observable, Promise, Future, Task, Job, Launcher, Async and some people can have a very distinction about them. Here I simply call it Signal, which is something that can signal values. MonadSignal and its Result are just monads, which are thing that can be mapped and chained. Signal makes use of deferred execution callback closures. It can be pushed or pulled. Which is just how the Signal updates its value and the order the callbacks are called. Execution callback closure means that we pass a function to another function. And the passed in function will get called when appropriated. Sync vs AsyncMonad can be in either sync or async mode. Sync is easier to understand, but async is somewhat you’re already familiar and used in practice. Basically, Sync: you get the returned value right away via return Async: you get the returned value via callback block Here is an example of simple sync and async free functions: // Sync func sum(a: Int, b: Int) -&gt; Int { return a + b } // Async func sum(a: Int, b: Int, completion: Int -&gt; Void) { // Assumed it is a very long task to get the result let result = a + b completion(result) }And how sync and async apply to Result type. Notice the async version, we get the transformed value in a completion closure instead of immediate return from function. enum Result&lt;T&gt; { case value(value: T) case failure(error: Error) // Sync public func map&lt;U&gt;(f: (T) -&gt; U) -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt; { switch self { case let .value(value): return .value(value: f(value)) case let .failure(error): return .failure(error: error) } } // Async public func map&lt;U&gt;(f: @escaping ((T), (U) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) -&gt; (((Result&lt;U&gt;) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) { return { g in // g: Result&lt;U&gt; -&gt; Void switch self { case let .value(value): f(value) { transformedValue in // transformedValue: U g(.value(value: transformedValue)) } case let .failure(error): g(.failure(error: error)) } } } }Push SignalGiven a chained signals like this: A -(map)-&gt; B -(flatMap)-&gt; C -(flatMap)-&gt; D -(subscribe) Push Signal, means that when the source signal A is sent an event, it propagates that event via callbacks. PushSignal is similar to PublishSubject in RxSwift. Triggered by sending event to the source signal. We must keep A as it keeps the others around We subscribe the last D We send event to the first A A ‘s callback gets called, it it in turn calls callback of B with the result of A ‘s map, then B ‘s callback calls C ‘s callback with the result of B‘s flatMap, and so on. It is similar to Promise A+, you can see my Swift implementation of Promise A+ in my Then framework. For now, here is the Swift 4 implementation of a simple PushSignal. public final class PushSignal&lt;T&gt; { var event: Result&lt;T&gt;? var callbacks: [(Result&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Void] = [] let lockQueue = DispatchQueue(label: &quot;Serial Queue&quot;) func notify() { guard let event = event else { return } callbacks.forEach { callback in callback(event) } } func update(event: Result&lt;T&gt;) { lockQueue.sync { self.event = event } notify() } public func subscribe(f: @escaping (Result&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt; { // Callback if let event = event { f(event) } callbacks.append(f) return self } public func map&lt;U&gt;(f: @escaping (T) -&gt; U) -&gt; Signal&lt;U&gt; { let signal = Signal&lt;U&gt;() _ = subscribe { event in signal.update(event: event.map(f: f)) } return signal } }Below is how a PushSignal is used to transform a chain from string to its length, you should see 4, the length of the string “test” printed. let signal = PushSignal&lt;String&gt;() _ = signal.map { value in return value.count }.subscribe { event in if case let .value(value) = event { print(value) } else { print(&quot;error&quot;) } } signal.update(event: .value(value: &quot;test&quot;))Pull SignalGiven a chained signals like this: A -(map)-&gt; B -(flatMap)-&gt; C -(flatMap)-&gt; D -(subscribe) Pull Signal, sometimes called Future, means when we subscribe to the final signal D, it causes the previous signals to action: Triggered by subscribing to the final signal D; We must keep D as it keeps the others around; We subscribe the last D; D ‘s operation runs, and it cause C ‘s operation to runs, … then A ‘s operation runs. It is in A that the task is performed (like fetching network, retrieving database, file access, heavy computation, …) to get the result, and A ‘s completion gets called. Then A’s completion calls B ‘s completion with the result mapped by B ‘s map, … all the way to the subscriber ‘s completion block. Here is a Swift 4 implementation of PullSignal. PullSignal is similar to Observablein RxSwift and SignalProducer in ReactiveSwift. public struct PullSignal&lt;T&gt; { let operation: ((Result&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void public init(operation: @escaping ((Result&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) { self.operation = operation } public func start(completion: (Result&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Void) { operation() { event in completion(event) } } public func map&lt;U&gt;(f: @escaping (T) -&gt; U) -&gt; PullSignal&lt;U&gt; { return PullSignal&lt;U&gt; { completion in self.start { event in completion(event.map(f: f)) } } } }The chain is inactive until you call start at the last signal in the chain, which triggers operation flow all over to the first signal. Run this snippet and you should see 4, the length of the string “test” printed on the console. let signal = PullSignal&lt;String&gt; { completion in // There should be some long running operation here completion(Result.value(value: &quot;test&quot;)) } signal.map { value in value.count }.start { event in if case let .value(value) = event { print(value) } else { print(&quot;error&quot;) } }I hope those snippets are simple enough to help you understand how signal works under the hood, and how to differentiate hot and cold signals. To get a fully working Signal framework, you need to implement more operations. Such as retry, rebounce, throttle, queue, flatten, filter, delay, combine and add support for UIKit like RxCocoa does. Find out how to implement in my Signal repo. Where to go from hereArchitecture is a very opinionated topic. Hopefully this article gives you some ideas to add into your decision points.

And by CollectionView, I actually mean UICollectionView 😉 . Most of the time, we show something with response from backend, then potentially update and insert new items as data changed. We can totally call reloadData to reflect the changes, but an animation is better here as it gives user better understanding of what’s going on, and to not surprise them. This talks about UICollectionView, but UITableView behaves the same Drag and DropLet’s imagine an app where user are allowed to customise their experience by moving items from one collection to another. You can take a look at the example DragAndDrop which is using the new drag and drop API in iOS 11. You must ensure that your data is changed before calling update methods on UICollectionView. And then we call deleteItems and insertItems to reflect data changes. UICollectionView performs a nice animation for you 12345678910111213func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, performDropWith coordinator: UICollectionViewDropCoordinator) &#123; let destinationIndexPath = coordinator.destinationIndexPath let sourceIndexPath = coordinator.items.last?.dragItem.localObject as!

Most the time you will get the following crashes Terminating app due to uncaught exception ‘NSInternalInconsistencyException’,reason: ‘Invalid update: invalid number of items in section 0.The number of items contained in an existing section after the update (213)must be equal to the number of items contained in that section beforethe update (154), plus or minus the number of items inserted ordeleted from that section (40 inserted, 0 deleted) and plusor minus the number of items moved into or out ofthat section (0 moved in, 0 moved out).’ In my experience it happened randomly because everyone has different data. Although the message is very descriptive, it may take a while to figure it out. Game of IndexPathLet’s refine our knowledge of IndexPath by going through some examples. With a collection of 6 items, we perform some update operations and figure out what IndexPath should be. 1items = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\"] Take a look at my example here CollectionUpdateExample, there are many more examples index vs offsetBefore we go any further, I just want to mention that, by index I actually mean offset from the start. If you take a look at the enumerated function, it suggests the name as offset instead of index 123Array(0..&lt;10).enumerated().forEach &#123; (offset, element) in&#125; This zero based numbering could shed some light on this matter Particularly in C, where arrays are closely tied to pointer arithmetic, this makes for a simpler implementation: the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array, so the first element has an offset of zero. 1. Insert 3 items at the end123456items.append(contentsOf: [\"g\", \"h\", \"i\"])// a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, ilet indexPaths = Array(6...8).map &#123; IndexPath(item: $0, section: 0) &#125;collectionView.insertItems(at: indexPaths) 2.

Delete 3 items at the beginning, then insert 3 items at the endWith multiple different operations, we should use performBatchUpdates You can use this method in cases where you want to make multiple changes to the collection view in one single animated operation, as opposed to in several separate animations. You might use this method to insert, delete, reload, or move cells or use it to change the layout parameters associated with one or more cells 123456789101112131415items.removeFirst()items.removeFirst()items.removeFirst()items.append(contentsOf: [\"g\", \"h\", \"i\"])// d, e, f, g, h, icollectionView.performBatchUpdates(&#123; let deleteIndexPaths = Array(0...2).map &#123; IndexPath(item: $0, section: 0) &#125; collectionView.deleteItems(at: deleteIndexPaths) let insertIndexPaths = Array(3...5).map &#123; IndexPath(item: $0, section: 0) &#125; collectionView.insertItems(at: insertIndexPaths)&#125;, completion: nil) 6.

If you take a look at the documentation Deletes are processed before inserts in batch operations. This means the indexes for the deletions are processed relative to the indexes of the collection view’s state before the batch operation, and the indexes for the insertions are processed relative to the indexes of the state after all the deletions in the batch operation. No matter how we call insert or delete, performBatchUpdates always performs deletions first. So we need to call deleteItems and insertItems as if the deletions occur first. 123456789101112131415items.append(contentsOf: [\"g\", \"h\", \"i\"])items.removeFirst()items.removeFirst()items.removeFirst()// d, e, f, g, h, icollectionView.performBatchUpdates(&#123; let deleteIndexPaths = Array(0...2).map &#123; IndexPath(item: $0, section: 0) &#125; collectionView.deleteItems(at: deleteIndexPaths) let insertIndexPaths = Array(3...5).map &#123; IndexPath(item: $0, section: 0) &#125; collectionView.insertItems(at: insertIndexPaths)&#125;, completion: nil) OperationsThere are many operations on UICollectionView, and there are operations to update whole section as well. Take a look Ordering of Operations and Index Paths 12345insertItems(at indexPaths: [IndexPath])deleteItems(at indexPaths: [IndexPath])reloadItems(at indexPaths: [IndexPath])moveItem(at indexPath: IndexPath, to newIndexPath: IndexPath)performBatchUpdates(_ updates, completion) 1234insertSections(_ sections: IndexSet)deleteSections(_ sections: IndexSet)reloadSections(_ sections: IndexSet)moveSection(_ section: Int, toSection newSection: Int) Edit distanceDoing these calculations by hand is quite tedious and error prone. We can build our own abstraction using some algorithms. The naive one is Wagner–Fischer algorithm which uses Dynamic Programming to tell the edit distance between two strings of characters. Edit distance means the number of steps needed to change from one string to another. String is just a collection of characters, so we can generalise this concept to make it work for any collection of items. Instead of comparing character, we require items to conform to Equatable “kit” -&gt; “kat”How can we transform form the word “kit” to “kat”? What kinds of operations do we nede to perform? You may tell “just change the i to a”, but this trivial example helps you understand the algorithm. Let’s get started. DeletionsIf we go from “kit” to an empty string “”, we need 3 deletions “k” -&gt; “” 👉 1 deletion“ki” -&gt; “” 👉 2 deletions“kit” -&gt; “” 👉 3 deletions InsertionsIf we go from an empty string “” to “kat”, we need 3 insertions “” -&gt; “k” 👉 1 insertion“” -&gt; “ka” 👉 2 insertions“” -&gt; “kat” 👉 3 insertions If equal, take value from the top leftYou can think of the algorithm as if we go from source string, to empty string, to destination string. We try to find the minimum steps to update. Going horizontally means insertions, vertically means deletions and diagonally means substitutions This way we can build our matrix, iterate from row to row, column by column. First, the letter “k” from source collection is the same with letter “k” from destination collection, we simply take value from the top left, which is 0 substituion If not equalWe continue with the next letter from the destination collection. Here “k” and “a” are not the same. We take minimum value from left, top, top left. Then increase by one Here we take value from left, which is horizontally, so we increase by 1 insertion “k” -&gt; “kat” 👉 2 insertionsContinue, they are not the same, so we take value from left horizontally. Here you can see it kind makes sense, as to go from “k” to “kat”, we need 2 insertions, which is to insert letters “a” and “t” The bottom right valueContinue with the next row, and next row until we got to the bottom right value, which gives you the edit distance. Here 1 substitution means that we need to perform 1 substitution to go from “kit” to “kat”, which is update “i” with “a’ You can easily see that we need to update index 1. But how do we know that it is index 1 🤔 Edit stepsIn each step, we need to associate the index of item in source and destination collection. You can take a look at my implementation DeepDiff ComplexityWe iterate through the matrix, with m and n are the length of source and destination collection respectively, we can see that the complexity of this algorithm is 0(mn). Also the performance greatly depends on the size of the collection and how complex the item is. The more complex and how deep you want to perform Equatable can greatly affect your performance. Improving performanceThe section How does it work shows several ways we can improve performance. Firstly, instead of building a matrix, which costs memory m*n, we can just use temporary arrays as holder. Secondly, to quickly compare 2 items, we can use Hashable, as 2 identical items will always have the same hash. More performanceIf you want better performance, then algorithms with linear complexity may be interested to you.

Things are fine until you get lost in the forest of flows, and code becomes hard to maintain. One way to avoid this is the central URL routing approach. Think of it as a network router that handles and resolves all routing requests. This way, the code becomes declarative and decoupled, so that the list component does not need to know what it’s presenting. URL routing also makes logging and tracking easy along with ease of handling external requests such as deep linking. There are various frameworks that perform URL routing. In this tutorial you’ll use Compass for its simplicity. You’ll refactor an existing app, which is a simplified Instagram app named PhotoFeed. When you’ve finished this tutorial, you’ll know how to declare and use routers with Compass and handle deep linking. Getting StartedDownload the starter project and unzip it. Go to the PhotoFeed folder and run pod install to install the particular dependencies for this project. Open PhotoFeed.xcworkspace and run the project. Tap Login to go to the Instagram login page and enter your Instagram credentials, then have a look around the app. The main app is made of a UITabBarController that shows the feed, the currently logged-in user profile and a menu. This is a typical Model View Controller project where UIViewController handles Cell delegates and takes responsibility for the navigation. For simplicity, all view controllers inherit from TableController and CollectionController that know how to manage list of a particular model and cell. All models conform to the new Swift 4 Codable protocol. Registering Your App on InstagramIn order to use the Instagram API, you’ll need to register your app at Instagram Developer. After obtaining your client id, switch back to the project. Go to APIClient.swift and modify your clientId. Note: The project comes with a default app with limited permissions. The app can’t access following or follower APIs, and you can only see your own posts and comments Compass 101The concept of Compass is very simple: you have a set of routes and central place for handling these routes. Think of a route as a navigation request to a specific screen within the app. The idea behind URL routing is borrowed from the modern web server. When user enters a URL into the browser, such as https://flawlessapp.io/category/ios, that request is sent from the browser to the web server. The server parses the URL and returns the requested content, such as HTML or JSON. Most web server frameworks have URL routing support, including ASP.NET, Express.js, and others. For example, here is how you handle a URL route in express.js: 1234app.get('/api/category/:categoryTag', function (req, res) &#123; const page = getCategoryPageFor(req.params.categoryTag) res.send(page)&#125;) Users or apps request a specific URL that express an intent about what should be returned or displayed. But instead of returning web pages, Compass constructs screens in terms of UIViewController and presents them. Route PatternsThis is how you declare a routing schema in Compass: 1Navigator.routes = [\"profile:&#123;userId&#125;\", \"post:&#123;postId&#125;\", \"logout\"] This is simply as array of patterns you register on the Navigator. This is the central place where you define all your routes. Since they are in one place, all your navigations are kept in one place and can easily be understood. Looking at the example above, {userId}, {postId} are placeholders that will be resolved to actual parameters. For example with post:BYOkwgXnwr3, you get userId of BYOkwgXnwr3. Compass also performs pattern matching, in that post:BYOkwgXnwr3 matches post:{postId}, not comment:{postId}, blogpost:{postId}, …This will become to make sense in following sections. The NavigatorThe Navigator is a the central place for routes registration, navigating and handling. The next step is to trigger a routing request. You can do that via the Navigator. For example, this is how you do in the feed to request opening a specific post: 1Navigator.navigate(urn: \"post:BYOkwgXnwr3\") Compass uses the user-friendly urn, short for Uniform Resource Name to make itwork seamlessly with Deep Linking. This urn matches the routing schema post:{postId}. Compass uses {param} as the special token to identifier the parameter and : as the delimiter. You can change the delimiter to something else by configuring Navigator.delimiter. You have learned how to register routes and navigate in Compass. Next, you will learn how to customize the handling code to your need. LocationNavigator parses and works with Location under the hood. Given the URN of post:BYOkwgXnwr3, you get a Location where path is the route pattern, and arguments contain the resolved parameters. 1234path = \"post:&#123;postId&#125;\"arguments = [ \"postId\": \"BYOkwgXnwr3\"] To actually perform the navigation, you assign a closure that takes a Location to Navigator.handle. 123456789101112131415Navigator.handle = &#123; [weak self] location in guard let `self` = self else &#123; return &#125; let arguments = location.arguments switch location.path &#123; case \"post:&#123;postId&#125;\": let postController = PostController(postId: postID) self.rootController.pushViewController(postController, animated: true) default: break &#125;&#125; The letself= self dance is to ensure self isn’t released by the time this closure is executed. If it is released, the routing it’s about to perform is likely invalid, and you return without doing anything instead. You should typically do the above in the components that own the root controller, such as AppDelegate as seen above. That’s the basic of Compass. Astute readers may have noticed that it does not scale, as the number of switch statements will grow as the number of routes and endpoints increase in your app. This is where the Routable protocol comes in. Anything conforming to Routable knows how to handle a specific route. Apps may have many modular sections, and each section may have a set of routes. Compass handles these scenario by using a composite Routable named Router that groups them . You can have a router for a pre-login module, a post-login module, premium features module, and so on. In the next section, you’ll change PhotoFeed to use Router and Routable. Router to the RescueThe first step is to include Compass in your project. Using CocoaPods, this is an easy task. Edit the Podfile with the project and type pod &#39;Compass&#39;, &#39;~&gt; 5.0&#39; just before the end statement. Then open Terminal and execute the following: 1pod install The version of Compass used in this tutorial is 5.1.0. Registering a Router To start, you’ll create a simple router to handle all post-login routes. Open AppDelegate.swift, and import Compass at the top of the file: 1import Compass Next, add the following router declaration under the var mainController: MainController? declaration: 1var postLoginRouter = Router() Then declare a function called setupRouting, you ‘ll do this in an extension to separate the routing setup from the main code in AppDelegate. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526extension AppDelegate &#123; func setupRouting() &#123; // [1] Register scheme Navigator.scheme = \"photofeed\" // [2] Configure routes for Router postLoginRouter.routes = [:] // [3] Register routes you 'd like to support Navigator.routes = Array(postLoginRouter.routes.keys) // [4] Do the handling Navigator.handle = &#123; [weak self] location in guard let selectedController = self?.mainController?.selectedViewController else &#123; return &#125; // [5] Choose the current visible controller let currentController = (selectedController as? UINavigationController)?.topViewController ?? selectedController // [6] Navigate self?.postLoginRouter.navigate(to: location, from: currentController) &#125; &#125;&#125; Here’s what you do in the above method: Declare a scheme for Compass to work. This is your application URL scheme. This shines when you wish to support deep linking . Register all the routes in your app. Router accepts a mapping of route and Routable conformers. This is empty for now, but you will add several routes in a moment. A Navigator can manage multiple routers. In this case, you only register one router. This is where you supply the handling closure. Navigator uses this to handle a resolved location request. Screens in one modular section originate from one root or parent view controller. In order to show something from the route, you should try to push or present it from the selected most-visible view controller. In this project, the root is a UITabBarController, so you try to get the top controller from the current selected navigation. The selection of current controller depends on the module and your app use cases, so Compass let you decide it. If you use the side menu drawer, then you can just change the selected view controller. Finally, since Router is a composite Routable, you dispatch to it the Location. Finally, you need to call this newly added function. Add the following line right above window?.makeKeyAndVisible(): 1setupRouting() Build and run. Nothing seems to work yet! To make things happen, you’ll need to add all the route handlers. You’ll do this in the next section. Implementing the Route HandlersFirst, create a new file and name it Routers.swift. This is where you’ll declare all of your route handlers. At the beginning of the file, add import Compass. Compass declares a simple protocol — Routable — that decides what to do with a given Location request from a Current Controller. If a request can’t be handled, it will throw with RouteError. Its implementation looks like this: 123public protocol Routable &#123; func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws&#125; It’s an incredibly simple protocol. Any routes you create only need to implement that single method. Now create your first handler to deal with user info request. 12345678910111213struct UserRoute: Routable &#123; func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws &#123; // [1] Examine arguments guard let userId = location.arguments[\"userId\"] else &#123; return &#125; // [2] Create the controller let controller = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"UserController\") as! UserController controller.userId = userId currentController.navigationController?.pushViewController(controller, animated: true) &#125;&#125; This is called when you touch the post author on the feed. Here’s what’s happening: UserRoute deals with user:{userId} urn, so location.arguments[&quot;userId&quot;] should contain the correct userId to inject into UserController. This app uses storyboards to make the UI, so get the correct view controller based on its identifier. Remember tha currentController is the current visible controller in the navigation stack. So you ask for its UINavigationController to push a new view controller. Right below this router, add one more route for the screen shown when the user wants to see who likes a particular post: 1234567891011struct LikesRoute: Routable &#123; func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws &#123; guard let mediaId = location.arguments[\"mediaId\"] else &#123; return &#125; let controller = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"LikesController\") as! LikesController controller.mediaId = mediaId currentController.navigationController?.pushViewController(controller, animated: true) &#125;&#125; The remaining RouteNow it’s your turn to write the other route handlers: CommentsRoute, FollowingRoute, FollowerRoute. See if you can figure it out first, you can find the solution below. Here’s what you should have: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435struct CommentsRoute: Routable &#123; func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws &#123; guard let mediaId = location.arguments[\"mediaId\"] else &#123; return &#125; let controller = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"CommentsController\") as! CommentsController controller.mediaId = mediaId currentController.navigationController?.pushViewController(controller, animated: true) &#125;&#125;struct FollowingRoute: Routable &#123; func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws &#123; guard let userId = location.arguments[\"userId\"] else &#123; return &#125; let controller = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"FollowingController\") as! FollowingController controller.userId = userId currentController.navigationController?.pushViewController(controller, animated: true) &#125;&#125;struct FollowerRoute: Routable &#123; func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws &#123; guard let userId = location.arguments[\"userId\"] else &#123; return &#125; let controller = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"FollowerController\") as! FollowerController controller.userId = userId currentController.navigationController?.pushViewController(controller, animated: true) &#125;&#125; The LogoutRouteThere is one more route to add: the one you’ll use for logout. LogoutRoute is quite tricky, as it usually involves changing the current root view controller. Who knows this better than the app delegate? Open AppDelegate.swift and add the following code at the very bottom: 123456struct LogoutRoute: Routable &#123; func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws &#123; APIClient.shared.accessToken = nil (UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).showLogin() &#125;&#125; Now that you’ve implemented all of the route handlers, you will have to tell Navigator which route is used for which URN. Still in AppDelegate.swift, find postLoginRouter.routes = [:] and replace it with the following: 12345678postLoginRouter.routes = [ \"user:&#123;userId&#125;\": UserRoute(), \"comments:&#123;mediaId&#125;\": CommentsRoute(), \"likes:&#123;mediaId&#125;\": LikesRoute(), \"following:&#123;userId&#125;\": FollowingRoute(), \"follower:&#123;userId&#125;\": FollowerRoute(), \"logout\": LogoutRoute()] Build the app and everything should compile. Now all that’s left is to actually all all of the code you’ve written! Refactoring TimeIt’s time to refactor all the code in UIViewController by replacing all the navigation code with your new routing instructions. Start by freeing the FeedController from the unnecessary tasks of navigation. Open FeedController.swift and add the following import to the top of the file: 1import Compass Next, look for // MARK: - MediaCellDelegate and replace the three MediaCell delegate methods with the following: 1234567891011func mediaCell(_ cell: MediaCell, didViewLikes mediaId: String) &#123; try? Navigator.navigate(urn: \"likes:\\(mediaId)\")&#125;func mediaCell(_ cell: MediaCell, didViewComments mediaId: String) &#123; try? Navigator.navigate(urn: \"comments:\\(mediaId)\")&#125;func mediaCell(_ cell: MediaCell, didSelectUserName userId: String) &#123; try? Navigator.navigate(urn: \"user:\\(userId)\")&#125; For these three cases, you simply want to navigate to another screen. Therefore, all you need to do is tell the Navigator where you want to go. For simplicity, you use try? to deal with any code that throws. Build and run the app. Search for your favorite post in the feed, and tap on the author, the post comments or likes to go to the target screen. The app behaves the same as it did before, but the code is now clean and declarative. Now do the same with UserController.swift. Add the following import to the top of the file: 1import Compass Replace the code after // MARK: - UserViewDelegate with the following: 1234567func userView(_ view: UserView, didViewFollower userId: String) &#123; try? Navigator.navigate(urn: \"follower:\\(userId)\")&#125;func userView(_ view: UserView, didViewFollowing userId: String) &#123; try? Navigator.navigate(urn: \"following:\\(userId)\")&#125; Your task now is to refactor with the last route LogoutRoute. Open MenuController.swift and add the following to the top: 1import Compass Remove the logout method altogether. Find the following: indexPath.section 12 logout()&#125; …and replace it with: 123if indexPath.section == Section.account.rawValue, indexPath.row == 0 &#123; try? Navigator.navigate(urn: \"logout\")&#125; Build and run the app, navigate to the menu and tap Logout. You should be taken to the login screen. Handling Deep LinkingDeep linking allows your apps to be opened via a predefined URN. The system identifies each app via its URL scheme. For web pages, the scheme is usually http, https. For Instagram it is, quite handily, instagram. Use cases for this are inter-app navigation and app advertisements. For examples, the Messenger app uses this to open the user profile in the Facebook app, and Twitter uses this to open the App Store to install another app from an advertisement. In order for user to be redirected back to PhotoFeed, you need to specify a custom URL scheme for your app. Remember where you declared Navigator.scheme = &quot;photofeed&quot;? PhotoFeed just so happens to conform to this URL scheme, so deep links already worked — and you didn’t even know it! Build and run the app, then switch to Safari. Type photofeed:// in the address bar, then tap Go. That will trigger your app to open. The app opens, but PhotoFeed doesn’t parse any parameters in the URL to go anywhere useful. Time to change that! Your app responds to the URL scheme opening by implementing a UIApplicationDelegate method. Add the following after setupRouting in AppDelegate.swift: 1234func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -&gt; Bool &#123; try? Navigator.navigate(url: url) return true&#125; Navigator parses and handles this for you. Build and run again. Go to Safari app, type photofeed://user:self and tap Go. Photofeed will open and show the currently logged in users’ profile. Because you already had UserRoute, the requested URL was handled gracefully. Your app may already be presenting a particular screen when a routing request comes, but you’ve anticipated this by resetting the navigation controller or presentation stack to show the requested screen. This simple solution works for most cases. Again, it’s recommended you pick the topmost visible view controller as the current controller in Navigator.handle. Deep linking is usually considered external navigation, in that the routing requests come from outside your app. Thanks to the central routing system that you developed, the code to handle external and internal routing requests is very much the same and involves no code duplication at all. Routing with Push NotificationsPush notifications help engage users with your app. You may have received messages like “Hey, checkout today ‘s most popular stories” on Medium, “Your friend has a birthday today” on Facebook, … and when you tap those banners, you are taken straight to that particular screen. How cool is that? This is achievable with your URL routing approach. Imagine users tapping a push notification banner saying “You’re a celebrity on PhotoFeed — check out your profile now!” and being sent directly to their profile screen. To accomplish this, you simply have to embed the URN info into the push payload and handle that in your app. Setting upTo start, you’ll need to specify your bundle ID. Go to Target Settings\\General to change your bundle ID as push notification requires a unique bundle ID to work. Your project uses com.fantageek.PhotoFeed by default. Next, you’ll need to register your App ID. Go to Member Center and register your App ID. Remember your Team ID, as you will need it in the final step. Also tick the Push Notification checkbox under Application Services. Now you’ll need to generate your Authentication Key. Apple provides Token Authentication as a new authentication mechanism for push notifications. The token is easy to generate, works for all your apps, and mostly, it never expires. Still in Member Center, create a new Key and download it as a .p8 file. Remember your Key ID as you will need it in the final step. Next up: enabling push notification capability. Back in Xcode, go to Target Settings\\Capabilities and enable Push Notifications, which will add PhotoFeed.entitlements to your project. The next step is to register for push notifications. Open MainController.swift and add the following import to the top of MainController.swift: 1import UserNotifications You want to enable push notification only after login, so MainController is the perfect place. UserNotifications is recommended for app targeting iOS 10 and above. 123456789101112override func viewDidLoad() &#123; super.viewDidLoad() // [1] Register to get device token for remote notifications UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications() // [2] Register to handle push notification UI let options: UNAuthorizationOptions = [.alert, .sound, .badge] UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: options) &#123; (granted, error) in print(error as Any) &#125;&#125; The permission dialog is shown once, so make sure you accept it. It’s time to handle the device token. Open AppDelegate.swift, and add the following to the end of extension AppDelegate: 123456789func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) &#123; // [1] Parse to token string let token = deviceToken.map &#123; return String(format: \"%02.2hhx\", $0) &#125;.joined() // [2] Log it print(\"Your device token is \\(token)\")&#125; This is where you get device token if your app successfully connects to APNs. Normally, you would send this device token to the backend so they can organize , but in this tutorial we just log it. It is required in the tool to be able to target a particular device. Handling payloadOpen AppDelegate.swift and add the following to th end of extension AppDelegate: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any], fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -&gt; Void) &#123; // [1] Always call the completion handler defer &#123; completionHandler(.newData) &#125; // [2] Convert into JSON dictionary guard let json = userInfo as? [String: Any] else &#123; return &#125; // [3] Parse to aps guard let aps = json[\"aps\"] as? [String: Any] else &#123; return &#125; // [4] Parse to urn guard let urn = aps[\"urn\"] as? String else &#123; return &#125; try? Navigator.navigate(urn: urn)&#125; This method is called when your app receives push notification payload and is running. The above code is relatively straightforward: it first tries to parse the urn information from the payload, then tells Navigator to do the job . Build and run the app on the device, since push notifications won’t work on the simulator. Log in to the app if prompted. Once on the main screen, grant push notification permissions to the app in order to receive alerts. You should see the device token logged to your Xcode console. Testing Push NotificationsIn this tutorial, you’ll use a tool called PushNotifications to help you easily create push notifications for your app. Download the tool PushNotifications from here. This tool sends payloads directly to APNs. Choose iOS\\Token to use Token Authentication, you get that by creating and downloading your Key from Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles. Browse for the .p8 auth key file that you downloaded earlier. Enter Team ID, you can check it by going to Membership Details Enter Key ID, this is the ID associated with the Key from the first step. Enter Bundle ID and device token. Paste the following into as. It is a traditional payload associated with the URN. 123456&#123; \"aps\":&#123; \"alert\":\"You become a celebrity on PhotoFeed, checkout your profile now\", \"urn\": \"user:self\" &#125;&#125; Since you’re debugging with Xcode, select Sandbox as environment. Tap Send now. If your app is in the background, an alert will appear. Tapping it will take you to your app and show you your user profile. Bravo! You just implemented deep linking in push notification, thanks again to the URL routing. Read moreHere is the final project with all the code from this tutorial.

We can use Groovy Binding. build.gradle does the import import groovy.lang.Binding automatically for us 12345678String environmentKey(variable) &#123; for (Object var : binding.variables) &#123; if (var.value == variable) &#123; return System.getenv(var.key) ?: variable &#125; &#125; return \"\"&#125; 1buildConfigField &apos;String&apos;, &apos;MY_KEY&apos;, environmentKey(MY_KEY) 2. Using Secured File 👍BuddyBuild allows us to define Secured File, here we can upload our gradle.properties And we can use Prebuild script to copy this secured file to our project. BuddyBuild suggests using buddybuild_prebuild.sh but then build fails in Build file &#39;/tmp/sandbox/workspace/app/build.gradle&#39; So, create a script called buddybuild_postclone.sh 123#!/usr/bin/env bashcp $BUDDYBUILD_SECURE_FILES/gradle.properties $BUDDYBUILD_WORKSPACE/gradle.properties","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"android","slug":"android","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/tags/android/"}]},{"title":"Communication between Fragment and Activity","slug":"Communication-between-Fragment-and-Activity","date":"2017-11-21T13:24:04.000Z","updated":"2019-08-15T19:21:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"blog/Communication-between-Fragment-and-Activity/","link":"","permalink":"https://onmyway133.github.io/blog/Communication-between-Fragment-and-Activity/","excerpt":"","text":"Issue #108 There’s always need for communication, right 😉 Suppose we have OnboardingActivity that has several OnboardingFragment. Each Fragment has a startButton telling that the onboarding flow has finished, and only the last Fragment shows this button. Here are several ways you can do that 1. EventBus 🙄Nearly all articles I found propose this https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus, but I personally don’t like this idea because components are loosely coupled, every component and broadcast can listen to event from a singleton, which makes it very hard to reason when the project scales 1data class OnboardingFinishEvent() 1234567891011121314151617class OnboardingActivity: AppCompatActivity() &#123; override fun onStart() &#123; super.onStart() EventBus.getDefault().register(this) &#125; override fun onStop() &#123; EventBus.getDefault().unregister(this) super.onStop() &#125; @Subscribe(threadMode = ThreadMode.MAIN) fun onOnboardingFinishEvent(event: OnboardingFinishEvent) &#123; // finish &#125;&#125; 123456789class OnboardingFragment: Fragment() &#123; override fun onViewCreated(view: View?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) &#123; super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState) startButton.onClick &#123; EventBus.getDefault().post(OnboardingFinishEvent()) &#125; &#125;&#125; Read more https://gunhansancar.com/ease-communication-between-activities-fragments-services/ 2. Otto 🙄This https://github.com/square/otto was deprecated in favor of RxJava and RxAndroid 3. RxJava 🙄We can use simple PublishSubject to create our own RxBus 12345678910111213141516import io.reactivex.Observableimport io.reactivex.subjects.PublishSubject// Use object so we have a singleton instanceobject RxBus &#123; private val publisher = PublishSubject.create&lt;Any&gt;() fun publish(event: Any) &#123; publisher.onNext(event) &#125; // Listen should return an Observable and not the publisher // Using ofType we filter only events that match that class type fun &lt;T&gt; listen(eventType: Class&lt;T&gt;): Observable&lt;T&gt; = publisher.ofType(eventType)&#125; 1234// OnboardingFragment.ktstartButton.onClick &#123; RxBus.publish(OnboardingFinishEvent())&#125; 12345678// OnboardingActivity.ktoverride fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) &#123; super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) RxBus.listen(OnboardingFinishEvent::class.java).subscribe(&#123; // finish &#125;)&#125; 4. InterfaceThis is advised here Communicating with Other Fragments. Basically you define an interface OnboardingFragmentDelegate that whoever conforms to that, can be informed by the Fragment of events. This is similar to Delegate pattern in iOS 😉 1234567891011121314151617181920212223interface OnboardingFragmentDelegate &#123; fun onboardingFragmentDidClickStartButton(fragment: OnboardingFragment)&#125;class OnboardingFragment: Fragment() &#123; var delegate: OnboardingFragmentDelegate? = null override fun onAttach(context: Context?) &#123; super.onAttach(context) if (context is OnboardingFragmentDelegate) &#123; delegate = context &#125; &#125; override fun onViewCreated(view: View?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) &#123; super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState) startButton.onClick &#123; delegate?.onboardingFragmentDidClickStartButton(this) &#125; &#125;&#125; 123456class OnboardingActivity: AppCompatActivity(), OnboardingFragmentDelegate &#123; override fun onboardingFragmentDidClickStartButton(fragment: OnboardingFragment) &#123; onboardingService.hasShown = true startActivity&lt;LoginActivity&gt;() &#125;&#125; 5. ViewModelWe can learn from Share data between fragments to to communication between Fragment and Activity, by using a shared ViewModel that is scoped to the activity. This is a bit overkill 123class OnboardingSharedViewModel: ViewModel() &#123; val finish = MutableLiveData&lt;Unit&gt;()&#125; 12345678910class OnboardingActivity: AppCompatActivity(), OnboardingFragmentDelegate &#123; override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) &#123; super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) val viewModel = ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(OnboardingSharedViewModel::class.java) viewModel.finish.observe(this, Observer &#123; startActivity&lt;LoginActivity&gt;() &#125;) &#125;&#125; Note that we need to call ViewModelProviders.of(activity) to get the same ViewModel with the activity 12345678910class OnboardingFragment: Fragment() &#123; override fun onViewCreated(view: View?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) &#123; super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState) val viewModel = ViewModelProviders.of(activity).get(OnboardingSharedViewModel::class.java) startButton.onClick(&#123; viewModel.finish.value = Unit &#125;) &#125;&#125; 7. LambdaCreate a lambda in Fragment, then set it on onAttachFragment. It does not work for now as there is no OnboardingFragment in onAttachFragment 😢 1234567891011class OnboardingFragment: Fragment() &#123; var didClickStartButton: (() -&gt; Unit)? = null override fun onViewCreated(view: View?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) &#123; super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState) startButton.onClick &#123; didClickStartButton?.invoke() &#125; &#125;&#125; 1234567891011class OnboardingActivity: AppCompatActivity() &#123; override fun onAttachFragment(fragment: Fragment?) &#123; super.onAttachFragment(fragment) (fragment as?

I’m always looking for ways to structure apps in a better way. But after some times, I see that we’re too creative in creating architecture, aka constraint, that is too far away from the platform that we’re building. I often think “If we’re going too far from the system, then it’s very hard to go back” I like things that embrace the system. One of them is Coordinator which helps in encapsulation and navigation. Thanks to my friend Vadym for showing me Coordinator in action. The below screenshot from @khanlou ‘s talk at CocoaHeads Stockholm clearly says many things about Coordinator But after reading A Better MVC, I think we can leverage view controller containment to do navigation using UIViewController only. Since I tend to call view controllers as LoginController, ProfileController, ... and the term flow to group those related screens, what should we call a Coordinator that inherits from UIViewController 🤔 Let’s call it FlowController 😎 . The name is not that important, but the concept is simple. FlowController was also inspired by this Flow Controllers on iOS for a Better Navigation Control back in 2014. The idea is from awesome iOS people, this is just a sum up from my experience 😇 So FlowController can just a UIViewController friendly version of Coordinator. Let see how FlowController fits better into MVC «UIViewController is the center of the universe.»— @onmyway133&mdash; Elvis Nuñez (@3lvis) 6. oktober 2017 1. FlowController and AppDelegateYour application starts from AppDelegate, in that you setup UIWindow. So we should follow the same “top down” approach for FlowController, starting with AppFlowController. You can construct all dependencies that your app need for AppFlowController, so that it can pass to other child FlowController. AppDelegate is also considered Composition Root Here is how to declare AppFlowController in AppDelegate 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536struct DependencyContainer: AuthServiceContainer, PhoneServiceContainer, NetworkingServiceContainer, LocationServiceContainer, MapServiceContainer, HealthServiceContainer &#123; let authService: AuthServiceProtocol let phoneService: PhoneService let networkingService: NetworkingService let locationService: LocationService let mapService: MapService let healthService: HealthService static func make() -&gt; DependencyContainer &#123; // Configure and make DependencyContainer here &#125;&#125;@UIApplicationMainclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate &#123; var window: UIWindow? var appFlowController: AppFlowController! func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -&gt; Bool &#123; appFlowController = AppFlowController( dependencyContainer: DependencyContainer.make() ) window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds) window?.rootViewController = appFlowController window?.makeKeyAndVisible() appFlowController.start() return true &#125;&#125; Here are some hypothetical FlowController that you may encounter AppFlowController: manages UIWindow and check whether to show onboarding, login or main depending on authentication state OnboardingFlowController: manages UIPageViewController and maybe ask for some permissions LoginFlowController: manages UINavigationController to show login, sms verification, forget password, and optionally start SignUpFlowController MainFlowController: manages UITabBarController with each tab serving main features FeedFlowController: show feed with list of items ProfileFlowController: show profile SettingsFlowController: show settings, and maybe call logout, this will delegates up the FlowController chain. The cool thing about FlowController is it makes your code very self contained, and grouped by features. So it’s easy to move all related things to its own package if you like. 2. FlowController as container view controller In general, a view controller should manage either sequence or UI, but not both. Basically, FlowController is just a container view controller to solve the sequence, based on a simple concept called composition. It manages many child view controllers in its flow. Let’ say we have a ProductFlowController that groups together flow related to displaying products, ProductListController, ProductDetailController, ProductAuthorController, ProductMapController, … Each can delegate to the ProductFlowController to express its intent, like ProductListController can delegate to say “product did tap”, so that ProductFlowController can construct and present the next screen in the flow, based on the embedded UINavigationController inside it. Normally, a FlowController just displays 1 child FlowController at a time, so normally we can just update its frame 1234567final class AppFlowController: UIViewController &#123; override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() &#123; super.viewDidLayoutSubviews() childViewControllers.first?.view.frame = view.bounds &#125;&#125; 3. FlowController as dependency containerEach view controller inside the flow can have different dependencies, so it’s not fair if the first view controller needs to carry all the stuff just to be able to pass down to the next view controllers. Here are some dependencies ProductListController: ProductNetworkingService ProductDetailController: ProductNetworkingService, ImageDowloaderService, ProductEditService ProductAuthorController: AuthorNetworkingService, ImageDowloaderService ProductMapController: LocationService, MapService Instead the FlowController can carry all the dependencies needed for that whole flow, so it can pass down to the view controller if needed. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829struct ProductDependencyContainer &#123; let productNetworkingService: ProductNetworkingService let imageDownloaderService: ImageDownloaderService let productEditService: ProductEditService let authorNetworkingService: AuthorNetworkingService let locationService: LocationService let mapService: MapService&#125;class ProductFlowController &#123; let dependencyContainer: ProductDependencyContainer init(dependencyContainer: ProductDependencyContainer) &#123; self.dependencyContainer = dependencyContainer &#125;&#125;extension ProductFlowController: ProductListControllerDelegate &#123; func productListController(_ controller: ProductListController, didSelect product: Product) &#123; let productDetailController = ProductDetailController( productNetworkingService: dependencyContainer.productNetworkingService, productEditService: dependencyContainer.productEditService, imageDownloaderService: dependencyContainer.imageDownloaderService ) productDetailController.delegate = self embeddedNavigationController.pushViewController(productDetailController, animated: true) &#125;&#125; Here are some ways that you can use to pass dependencies into FlowController Using protocol compositon for dependency injection Dependency injection using factories in Swift 4. Adding or removing child FlowControllerCoordinator With Coordinator, you need to keep an array of child Coordinators, and maybe use address (=== operator) to identify them 1234567891011121314151617181920212223class Coordinator &#123; private var children: [Coordinator] = [] func add(child: Coordinator) &#123; guard !children.contains(where: &#123; $0 === child &#125;) else &#123; return &#125; children.append(child) &#125; func remove(child: Coordinator) &#123; guard let index = children.index(where: &#123; $0 === child &#125;) else &#123; return &#125; children.remove(at: index) &#125; func removeAll() &#123; children.removeAll() &#125;&#125; FlowController With FlowController, since it is UIViewController subclass, it has viewControllers to hold all those child FlowController. Just add these extensions to simplify your adding or removing of child UIViewController 12345678910111213extension UIViewController &#123; func add(childController: UIViewController) &#123; addChildViewController(childController) view.addSubview(childController.view) childController.didMove(toParentViewController: self) &#125; func remove(childController: UIViewController) &#123; childController.willMove(toParentViewController: nil) childController.view.removeFromSuperview() childController.removeFromParentViewController() &#125;&#125; And see in action how AppFlowController work with adding 1234567891011121314151617181920212223final class AppFlowController: UIViewController &#123; func start() &#123; if authService.isAuthenticated &#123; startMain() &#125; else &#123; startLogin() &#125; &#125; private func startLogin() &#123; let loginFlowController = LoginFlowController( loginFlowController.delegate = self add(childController: loginFlowController) loginFlowController.start() &#125; fileprivate func startMain() &#123; let mainFlowController = MainFlowController() mainFlowController.delegate = self add(childController: mainFlowController) mainFlowController.start() &#125;&#125; and with removing when the child FlowController finishes 123456extension AppFlowController: LoginFlowControllerDelegate &#123; func loginFlowControllerDidFinish(_ flowController: LoginFlowController) &#123; remove(childController: flowController) startMain() &#125;&#125; 5. AppFlowController does not need to know about UIWindowCoordinator Usually you have an AppCoordinator, which is held by AppDelegate, as the root of your Coordinator chain. Based on login status, it will determine which LoginController or MainController will be set as the rootViewController, in order to do that, it needs to be injected a UIWindow 1234window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)appCoordinator = AppCoordinator(window: window!)appCoordinator.start()window?.makeKeyAndVisible() You can guess that in the start method of AppCoordinator, it must set rootViewController before window?.makeKeyAndVisible() is called. 123456789101112131415final class AppCoordinator: Coordinator &#123; private let window: UIWindow init(window: UIWindow) &#123; self.window = window &#125; func start() &#123; if dependencyContainer.authService.isAuthenticated &#123; startMain() &#125; else &#123; startLogin() &#125; &#125;&#125; FlowController But with AppFlowController, you can treat it like a normal UIViewController, so just setting it as the rootViewController 123456appFlowController = AppFlowController(window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)window?.rootViewController = appFlowControllerwindow?.makeKeyAndVisible()appFlowController.start() 6. LoginFlowController can manage its own flowSupposed we have login flow based on UINavigationController that can display LoginController, ForgetPasswordController, SignUpController Coordinator What should we do in the start method of LoginCoordinator? Construct the initial controller LoginController and set it as the rootViewController of the UINavigationController? LoginCoordinator can create this embedded UINavigationController internally, but then it is not attached to the rootViewController of UIWindow, because UIWindow is kept privately inside the parent AppCoordinator. We can pass UIWindow to LoginCoordinator but then it knows too much. One way is to construct UINavigationController from AppCoordinator and pass that to LoginCoordinator 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829final class AppCoordinator: Coordinator &#123; private let window: UIWindow private func startLogin() &#123; let navigationController = UINavigationController() let loginCoordinator = LoginCoordinator(navigationController: navigationController) loginCoordinator.delegate = self add(child: loginCoordinator) window.rootViewController = navigationController loginCoordinator.start() &#125;&#125;final class LoginCoordinator: Coordinator &#123; private let navigationController: UINavigationController init(navigationController: UINavigationController) &#123; self.navigationController = navigationController &#125; func start() &#123; let loginController = LoginController(dependencyContainer: dependencyContainer) loginController.delegate = self navigationController.viewControllers = [loginController] &#125;&#125; FlowController LoginFlowController leverages container view controller so it fits nicely with the way UIKit works. Here AppFlowController can just add LoginFlowController and LoginFlowController can just create its own embeddedNavigationController. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132final class AppFlowController: UIViewController &#123; private func startLogin() &#123; let loginFlowController = LoginFlowController( dependencyContainer: dependencyContainer ) loginFlowController.delegate = self add(childController: loginFlowController) loginFlowController.start() &#125;&#125;final class LoginFlowController: UIViewController &#123; private let dependencyContainer: DependencyContainer private var embeddedNavigationController: UINavigationController! weak var delegate: LoginFlowControllerDelegate? init(dependencyContainer: DependencyContainer) &#123; self.dependencyContainer = dependencyContainer super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil) embeddedNavigationController = UINavigationController() add(childController: embeddedNavigationController) &#125; func start() &#123; let loginController = LoginController(dependencyContainer: dependencyContainer) loginController.delegate = self embeddedNavigationController.viewControllers = [loginController] &#125;&#125; 7. FlowController and responder chainCoordinator Sometimes we want a quick way to bubble up message to parent Coordinator, one way to do that is to replicate UIResponder chain using associated object and protocol extensions, like Inter-connect with Coordinator 12345678910111213141516171819202122extension UIViewController &#123; private struct AssociatedKeys &#123; static var ParentCoordinator = \"ParentCoordinator\" &#125; public var parentCoordinator: Any? &#123; get &#123; return objc_getAssociatedObject(self, &amp;AssociatedKeys.ParentCoordinator) &#125; set &#123; objc_setAssociatedObject(self, &amp;AssociatedKeys.ParentCoordinator, newValue, .OBJC_ASSOCIATION_ASSIGN) &#125; &#125;&#125;open class Coordinator&lt;T: UIViewController&gt;: UIResponder, Coordinating &#123; open var parent: Coordinating? override open var coordinatingResponder: UIResponder? &#123; return parent as? UIResponder &#125;&#125; FlowController Since FlowController is UIViewController, which inherits from UIResponder, responder chain happens out of the box Responder objects—that is, instances of UIResponder—constitute the event-handling backbone of a UIKit app. Many key objects are also responders, including the UIApplication object, UIViewController objects, and all UIView objects (which includes UIWindow). As events occur, UIKit dispatches them to your app’s responder objects for handling. 8. FlowController and trait collectionFlowController I very much like how Kickstarter uses trait collection in testing. Well, since FlowController is a parent view controller, we can just override its trait collection, and that will affect the size classes of all view controllers inside that flow. As in A Better MVC, Part 2: Fixing Encapsulation The huge advantage of this approach is that system features come free. Trait collection propagation is free. View lifecycle callbacks are free. Safe area layout margins are generally free. The responder chain and preferred UI state callbacks are free. And future additions to UIViewController are also free. From setOverrideTraitCollection When implementing a custom container view controller, you can use this method to change the traits of any embedded child view controllers to something more appropriate for your layout. Making such a change alters other view controller behaviors associated with that child 1234567let trait = UITraitCollection(traitsFrom: [ .init(horizontalSizeClass: .compact), .init(verticalSizeClass: .regular), .init(userInterfaceIdiom: .phone)])appFlowController.setOverrideTraitCollection(trait, forChildViewController: loginFlowController) 9. FlowController and back buttonCoordinator One problem with UINavigationController is that clicking on the default back button pops the view controller out of the navigation stack, so Coordinator is not aware of that. With Coordinator you needs to keep Coordinator and UIViewController in sync, add try to hook up UINavigationControllerDelegate in order to clean up. Like in Back Buttons and Coordinators 1234567891011121314151617extension Coordinator: UINavigationControllerDelegate &#123; func navigationController(navigationController: UINavigationController, didShowViewController viewController: UIViewController, animated: Bool) &#123; // ensure the view controller is popping guard let fromViewController = navigationController.transitionCoordinator?.viewController(forKey: .from), !navigationController.viewControllers.contains(fromViewController) else &#123; return &#125; // and it's the right type if fromViewController is FirstViewControllerInCoordinator) &#123; //deallocate the relevant coordinator &#125; &#125;&#125; Or creating a class called NavigationController that inside manages a list of child coordinators. Like in Navigation coordinators 12345678910111213141516171819202122final class NavigationController: UIViewController &#123; // MARK: - Inputs private let rootViewController: UIViewController // MARK: - Mutable state private var viewControllersToChildCoordinators: [UIViewController: Coordinator] = [:] // MARK: - Lazy views private lazy var childNavigationController: UINavigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: self.rootViewController) // MARK: - Initialization init(rootViewController: UIViewController) &#123; self.rootViewController = rootViewController super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil) &#125;&#125; FlowController Since FlowController is just plain UIViewController, you don’t need to manually manage child FlowController. The child FlowController is gone when you pop or dismiss. If we want to listen to UINavigationController events, we can just handle that inside the FlowController 1234567891011121314151617181920final class LoginFlowController: UIViewController &#123; private let dependencyContainer: DependencyContainer private var embeddedNavigationController: UINavigationController! weak var delegate: LoginFlowControllerDelegate? init(dependencyContainer: DependencyContainer) &#123; self.dependencyContainer = dependencyContainer super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil) embeddedNavigationController = UINavigationController() embeddedNavigationController.delegate = self add(childController: embeddedNavigationController) &#125;&#125;extension LoginFlowController: UINavigationControllerDelegate &#123; func navigationController(_ navigationController: UINavigationController, willShow viewController: UIViewController, animated: Bool) &#123; &#125;&#125; 10. FlowController and callbackWe can use delegate pattern to notify FlowController to show another view controller in the flow 123456789101112extension ProductFlowController: ProductListControllerDelegate &#123; func productListController(_ controller: ProductListController, didSelect product: Product) &#123; let productDetailController = ProductDetailController( productNetworkingService: dependencyContainer.productNetworkingService, productEditService: dependencyContainer.productEditService, imageDownloaderService: dependencyContainer.imageDownloaderService ) productDetailController.delegate = self embeddedNavigationController.pushViewController(productDetailController, animated: true) &#125;&#125; Another approach is to use closure as callback, as proposed by @merowing_, and also in his post Improve your iOS Architecture with FlowControllers Using closures as triggers rather than delegate allows for more readable and specialized implementation, and multiple contexts 12345678910111213final class ProductFlowController &#123; func start() &#123; let productListController = ProductListController( productNetworkingService: dependencyContainer.productNetworkingService ) productListController.didSelectProduct = &#123; [weak self] product in self?.showDetail(for: product) &#125; embeddedNavigationController.viewControllers = [productListController] &#125;&#125; 11.

I like open source. I ‘ve made some and contributed to some. I also use other people ‘s open source libraries and learn a lot from them 😇 Open source can help us build better, faster and maybe more performant software by basing on other people ‘s hard work. We can also collaborate and make it better. But it’s also a double edges sword if you’re not judging carefully. Putting a little bit more dedicationYou can skip this post if your project is just for fun, and you don’t care about future maintenance. If you’re making client or product projects, you should care and put a little more dedication into it. The company and your teammates trust you to do the good work. I’ve admitted that I ‘ve done node.js and electron.js. The choice is because it’s just a utility that I want to make quickly, and there ‘s many node.js packages that I can use immediately. I have little experience in node.js, so I accept the risk do get the work done. But if you’re experienced developer in your platform, and it’s your important project, then it’s a different story 💥 I’m kind of experimental person, so I always want to try new things. But I also learn the hard way to not over engineer, and to live as close to the system as possible. I just read Much ado about iOS app architecture and I agree with most of the points, that we shouldn’t fight the SDK and replace system frameworks.

It means nearly nothing. The star is just the result of some marketing effort. Being featured or not in a newsletter can make 1k stars difference. Just because it was featured in a newsletter does not necessarily mean that it is good 😬 You should judge it yourself by checking how good the source code is, how many documentation are available, and whether there is unit tests or not. The author is just human, so he can’t help maintain the library forever. You’re taking a big risk if you don’t have good picture of the library. The system, especially iOS, changes very often. There are some libraries that try to “replicate” system APIs or perform type checking for every possible types. It can be that the author pick the most common use cases, or just trying to provide a cleaner APIs to the user. But if things change, will that author be willing to fix that? Will you be stuck there and making another issue asking for help? We’re making life better, not traps for everyone to fall into 🙀 Here I don’t try to blame anyone, “you is not your work”. I just say that you should check it more thoroughly. You can consult your colleagues and discuss if it’s good to integrate. Most of the time, pulling a huge library just for some tiny syntactic sugar does not worth it I just put some random links here and you can determine if you like or not https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/blob/master/Sources/SwiftyUserDefaults.swift#L145 https://github.com/jiecao-fm/SwiftTheme/blob/master/Source/UIKit%2BTheme.swift#L183 https://github.com/erichoracek/Motif/blob/7ec2dfce45cd93cb5ae22f4f512a41a499138fd5/Examples/ButtonsExample/ThemeThemeSymbols.m#L10 https://github.com/vhesener/Closures/blob/master/Xcode/Closures/Source/UITableView.swift#L251 https://github.com/Draveness/DKNightVersion/blob/master/DKNightVersion/UIKit/UITableView%2BNight.m#L29 https://github.com/tombenner/nui/blob/master/NUI/Core/NUISwizzler.m#L15 https://github.com/square/SuperDelegate/blob/master/Sources/SuperDelegate%2BLocalNotifications.swift#L53 https://github.com/orta/ARAnalytics/blob/master/ARDSL.m#L113 https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit/blob/develop/Source/ConstraintMakerRelatable.swift#L43 https://github.com/saoudrizwan/DynamicJSON/blob/master/Sources/DynamicJSON.swift#L54 PleaseWould you take a very big risk for so little return ? Always implement and imagine that you will be the next maintainer for the project, then you will act differently. So the next time, please reconsider your choice of libraries.

And by conforming to Codable, it is easily encoded and decoded to and from json data. And persisting them to Cache is as easy as eating cookie. The other day, I saw someone asking on how to migrate if the model changes https://github.com/hyperoslo/Cache/issues/153, and he likes the way Realm does https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#migrations 123456789101112131415Realm.Configuration.defaultConfiguration = Realm.Configuration( schemaVersion: 1, migrationBlock: &#123; migration, oldSchemaVersion in if (oldSchemaVersion &lt; 1) &#123; // The enumerateObjects(ofType:_:) method iterates // over every Person object stored in the Realm file migration.enumerateObjects(ofType: Person.className()) &#123; oldObject, newObject in // combine name fields into a single field let firstName = oldObject![\"firstName\"] as!

Such a search is important to the cultural belief that discovering one’s ikigai brings satisfaction and meaning to life.[1] The term ikigai compounds two Japanese words: iki (wikt:生き) meaning “life; alive” and kai (甲斐) “(an) effect; (a) result; (a) fruit; (a) worth; (a) use; (a) benefit; (no, little) avail” (sequentially voiced as gai) “a reason for living [being alive]; a meaning for [to] life; what [something that] makes life worth living; a raison d’etre”.[3] About college degree https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8QY0NDWqzk What you learn is more important Surrounded with smart people Safe way College degree is nothing.

For most purposes, the actual size of a point is irrelevant.

When you work with features, like map view, you mostly need permissions, and in UITests you need to test for system alerts. Add interruption monitorThis is the code. Note that you need to call app.tap() to interact with the app again, in order for interruption monitor to work 123456addUIInterruptionMonitor(withDescription: \"Location permission\", handler: &#123; alert in alert.buttons[\"Allow\"].tap() return true&#125;)app.tap() Note that you don’t always need to handle the returned value of addUIInterruptionMonitor Only tap when neededOne problem with this approach is that when there is no system alert (you already touched to allow before), then app.tap() will tap on your main screen. In my app which uses map view, it will tap on some pins, which will present another screen, which is not correct. Since app.alerts does not work, my 2nd attempt is to check for app.windows.count. Unfortunately, it always shows 5 windows whether alert is showing or not. I know 1 is for main window, 1 is for status bar, the other 3 windows I have no idea. The 3rd attempt is to check that underlying elements (behind alert) can’t be touched, which is to use isHittable. This property does not work, it always returns true Check the contentThis uses the assumption that we only tests for when user hits Allow button. So only if alert is answered with Allow, then we have permission to display our content. For my map view, I check that there are some pins on the map. See https://github.com/onmyway133/blog/issues/45 on how to mock location and identify the pins 123if app.otherElements.matching(identifier: &quot;myPin&quot;).count == 0 &#123; app.tap()&#125; When there is no permissionSo how can we test that user has denied your request? In my map view, if user does not allow location permission, I show a popup asking user to go to Settings and change it, otherwise, they can’t interact with the map. I don’t know how to toggle location in Privacy in Settings, maybe XCUISiriService can help. But 1 thing we can do is to mock the application Before you launch the app in UITests, add some arguments 1app.launchArguments.append(&quot;--UITests-mockNoLocationPermission&quot;) and in the app, we need to check for this arguments 12345func checkLocationPermission() &#123; if CommandLine.arguments.contains(\"--UITests-mockNoLocationPermission\") &#123; showNoLocationPopupAndAskUserToEnableInSettings() &#125;&#125; That’s it.

And here are some of my notes on it. Challenges The challenges with Facebook is it uses Safari controller, we we deal mostly with web view for now. Starting from iOS 9+, Facebook decided to use safari instead of native facebook app to avoid app switching. You can read the detail here Building the Best Facebook Login Experience for People on iOS 9 It does not have wanted accessibilityIdentifier or accessibilityLabel The webview content may change in the future 😸 Create a Facebook test userLuckily, you don’t have to create your own Facebook user to test. Facebook supports test users that you can manage permissions and friends, very handy When creating the test user, you have the option to select language. That will be the displayed language in Safari web view. I choose Norwegian 🇳🇴 for now Click the login button and show Facebook loginHere we use the default FBSDKLoginButton 123var showFacebookLoginFormButton: XCUIElement &#123; return buttons[\"Continue with Facebook\"]&#125; And then tap it 1app.showFacebookLoginFormButton.tap() Check login statusWhen going to safari Facebook form, user may have already logged in or not. So we need to handle these 2 cases. When user has logged in, Facebook will say something like “you have already logged in” or the OK button. The advice here is to put breakpoint and po app.staticTexts, po app.buttons to see which UI elements are at a certain point. You can check for the static text, or simply just the OK button 123var isAlreadyLoggedInSafari: Bool &#123; return buttons[\"OK\"].exists || staticTexts[\"Du har allerede godkjent Blue Sea.\"].exists&#125; Wait and refreshBut Facebook form is a webview, so its content is a bit dynamic. And UITest seems to cache content for fast query, so before checking staticTexts, we need to wait and refresh the cache 1app.clearCachedStaticTexts() This is the wait function 12345678910111213extension XCTestCase &#123; func wait(for duration: TimeInterval) &#123; let waitExpectation = expectation(description: \"Waiting\") let when = DispatchTime.now() + duration DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: when) &#123; waitExpectation.fulfill() &#125; // We use a buffer here to avoid flakiness with Timer on CI waitForExpectations(timeout: duration + 0.5) &#125;&#125; Wait for element to appearBut a more solid approach would be to wait for element to appear. For Facebook login form, they should display a Facebook label after loading. So we should wait for this element 123456789101112extension XCTestCase &#123; /// Wait for element to appear func wait(for element: XCUIElement, timeout duration: TimeInterval) &#123; let predicate = NSPredicate(format: \"exists == true\") let _ = expectation(for: predicate, evaluatedWith: element, handler: nil) // Here we don't need to call `waitExpectation.fulfill()` // We use a buffer here to avoid flakiness with Timer on CI waitForExpectations(timeout: duration + 0.5) &#125;&#125; And call this before you do any further inspection on elements in Facebook login form 1wait(for: app.staticTexts[\"Facebook\"], timeout: 5) If user is logged inAfter login, my app shows the main controller with a map view inside. So a basic test would be to check the existence of that map 1234567if app.isAlreadyLoggedInSafari &#123; app.okButton.tap() handleLocationPermission() // Check for the map XCTAssertTrue(app.maps.element(boundBy: 0).exists)&#125; Handle interruptionYou know that when showing the map with location, Core Location will ask for permission. So we need to handle that interruption as well. You need to ensure to call it early before the alert happens 123456fileprivate func handleLocationPermission() &#123; addUIInterruptionMonitor(withDescription: \"Location permission\", handler: &#123; alert in alert.buttons.element(boundBy: 1).tap() return true &#125;)&#125; There is another problem, this monitor won’t be called. So the workaround is to call app.tap() again when the alert will happen. In my case, I call app.tap() when my map has been shown for 1,2 seconds, just to make sure app.tap() is called after alert is shown For a more detailed guide, please read https://github.com/onmyway133/blog/issues/48 If user is not logged inIn this case, we need to fill in email and password. You can take a look at the The full source code section below. When things don’t work or po does not show you the elements you needed, it’s probably because of caching or you need to wait until dynamic content finishes rendering.

Just declare the constraints and the views are resized accordingly to their parent ‘s bounds changes. But sometimes it does not look good, because we have fixed values for padding, width, height, and even fixed font size. Read more How to make Auto Layout more convenient in iOS This can be solved by some degree using Size Class. The idea of size class is that we have many sets of constraints, and based on the device traits, we enabled some of them. This is more convenient to do in Storyboard (although very hard to reason about), but if we’re doing in code (my prefer way), then it is a lot of code. And a lot of code means a lot of bugs. If you take a look at iOSRes, we see the ratio 16:9 (height:width) iPhone SE (320 x 568): 1.775 iPhone 6 (375 x 667): 1.778 iPhone 6+ (414 x 736): 1.778 They mostly have the same ratio. So we can have a simple approach, that scale elements based on ratio. Given the fact that the designer usually designs for iPhone 6 size, we can make that a base. In this approach, the content will scale up or down depending on its ratio. You may argue that the idea of bigger phone is to display more, not to show the same content bigger. You may be right, in that case you need to create different constraints and different UIs.

For Xcode 7, the SDK is iOS 9 If we upgrade Xcode, it will use the newer version of the SDK. Like Xcode 7.2, the SDK is iOS 9.1 Choosing the latest SDK for your project lets you use the new APIs introduced in the OS update that corresponds to that SDK. When new functionality is added as part of a system update, the system update itself does not typically contain updated header files reflecting the change. The SDKs, however, do contain updated header files. Deployment Target We can set in Xcode -&gt; Target -&gt; Deployment Info -&gt; Deployment Target State that we support this iOS version What does it mean So, a modern App might use iOS 9 as the Target SDK, and iOS 7 as the deployment target. This means that you can run on iOS 7, iOS 8 and iOS 9, and that you have available to you any iOS 9 calls when actually running on iOS 9. . Each .sdk directory resembles the directory hierarchy of the operating system release it represents: It has usr, System, and Developer directories at its top level. OS X .sdk directories also contain a Library directory. Each of these directories in turn contains subdirectories with the headers and libraries that are present in the corresponding version of the operating system with Xcode installed. . The libraries in an iOS or OS X SDK are stubs for linking only; they do not contain executable code but just the exported symbols. SDK support works only with native build targets. So the SDK is just like stub and header only. It means that we can use certain APIs, but on OS that does not have the real symbols for those APIs, it crashes availableSwift 2 introduces available construct that guards against failure when trying to use newer APIs. Note that available is runtime, not compile time. All the code is inside your executable 12345if #available(iOS 9, OSX 10.10, *) &#123; // Code to execute on iOS 9, OS X 10.10&#125; else &#123;&#125; deprecated APIs Finding Instances of Deprecated API Usage Always check to see if you are using deprecated APIs; though still available, deprecated APIs are not guaranteed to be available in the future Compile time vs Runtime Conditionally Compiling for Different SDKs 12345#if (arch(i386) || arch(x86_64)) &amp;&amp; os(iOS) // code inside gets inserted into executable when builds for simulator#else // code inside gets inserted into executable when builds for device#endif 12345#if os(OSX) import Cocoa#elseif os(iOS) import UIKit#endif 123456// All the code gets inserted into executable, but is run depending on the version of the OSif #available(iOS 9, *) &#123; // use UIStackView&#125; else &#123; // show your manual Auto Layout skill&#125; Weakly vs strongly linked Weak Linking and Apple Frameworks What does it mean to “weak-link” a framework? Frameworks and Weak Linking For example, suppose in Xcode you set the deployment target (minimum required version) to “OS X v10.5” and the base SDK (maximum allowed version) to “OS X v10.6”. During compilation, the compiler would weakly link interfaces that were introduced in OS X v10.6 while strongly linking interfaces defined in earlier versions of the OS. This would allow your application to run in OS X v10.5 and take advantage of newer features when available. . None of the (platform) frameworks is really “included in the bundle”. Instead, your app has a reference (“link”) to a framework once you add it to the “Link Binary with Library” build phase. The frameworks are pre-installed on the devices. When you run an app, all the app’s framework references are resolved by the dynamic linker (on the device), which means the framework code is loaded so your app can use it.

The other day, I was practise making Signal based on this talk UIKonf 2015 - Jens Ravens: Functional Reactive Programming without Black Magic Take a look at my repo Signal filterI was making a filter for a Signal. The idea of filter is that we should update signal if the Event is Next with right filtered value Signal.swift 12345678910111213public func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt;&#123; let signal = Signal&lt;T&gt;() subscribe &#123; result in switch(result) &#123; case let .Success(value): if f(value) &#123; signal.update(result) &#125; case let .Error(error): signal.update(.Error(error)) &#125; &#125; return signal&#125; 2 paramsBut having Event as another monad, I think it should be more encapsulated if that switching logic gets moved into the Event. Here the filter takes 2 params Event.swift 12345678910func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool, callback: (Event&lt;T&gt; -&gt; Void)) &#123; switch self &#123; case let .Next(value) where f(value): callback(self) case .Failed: callback(self) default: break &#125;&#125; Signal.swift 123456789public func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt; &#123; let signal = Signal&lt;T&gt;() subscribe &#123; event in event.filter(f, callback: signal.update) &#125; return signal&#125; CurryingWith currying, we can make filter a more abstract function, and defer the decision to pass the callback param.

If your app previously registered for remote notifications, calling the registerForRemoteNotifications method again does not incur any additional overhead, and iOS returns the existing device token to your app delegate immediately. In addition, iOS calls your delegate method any time the device token changes, not just in response to your app registering or re-registering The user can change the notification settings for your app at any time using the Settings app. Because settings can change, always call the registerUserNotificationSettings: at launch time and use the application:didRegisterUserNotificationSettings: method to get the response. If the user disallows specific notification types, avoid using those types when configuring local and remote notifications for your app. didReceiveRemoteNotificationAbout application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: Implement the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: method instead of this one whenever possible. If your delegate implements both methods, the app object calls the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: method. If the app is not running when a remote notification arrives, the method launches the app and provides the appropriate information in the launch options dictionary. The app does not call this method to handle that remote notification. Instead, your implementation of the application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions: or application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method needs to get the remote notification payload data and respond appropriately. About application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: This is for silent push notification with content-available Unlike the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: method, which is called only when your app is running in the foreground, the system calls this method when your app is running in the foreground or background In addition, if you enabled the remote notifications background mode, the system launches your app (or wakes it from the suspended state) and puts it in the background state when a push notification arrives. However, the system does not automatically launch your app if the user has force-quit it. In that situation, the user must relaunch your app or restart the device before the system attempts to launch your app automatically again. If the user opens your app from the system-displayed alert, the system may call this method again when your app is about to enter the foreground so that you can update your user interface and display information pertaining to the notification. How to handleUsually, the use of push notification is to display a specific article, a specific DetailViewController, … in your app. So the good practices are When the app is in foreground: Gently display some kind of alert view and ask the user whether he would like to go to that specific page or not When user is brought from background to foreground, or from terminated to foreground: Just navigate to that specific page. For example, if you use UINavigationController, you can set that specific page the top most ViewController, if you use UITabBarController, you can set that specific page the selected tab, something like that 1234567891011- func handlePushNotification(userInfo: NSDictionary) &#123; // Check applicationState if (applicationState == UIApplicationStateActive) &#123; // Application is running in foreground showAlertForPushNotification(userInfo) &#125; else if (applicationState == UIApplicationStateBackground || applicationState == UIApplicationStateInactive) &#123; // Application is brought from background or launched after terminated handlePushNotification(userInfo) &#125;&#125; Here we create another method `handlePushNotification:`` to handle push notification. When you receive push notification, 3 cases can occur Case 1: ForegroundLoud push No system alert application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: called Silent push No system alert application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: called Case 2: BackgroundLoud push System alert No method called Tap notification and application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: called Tap on App Icon and nothing is called Silent push System alert application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: called. If app is suspended, its state changed to UIApplicationStateBackground Tap notification and application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: called Tap on App Icon and nothing is called Case 3: TerminatedLoud push System alert No method called Tap notification and application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: with launchOptions, application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: called Tap on App Icon and application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: is called with launchOptions set to nil Silent push System alert application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: called. If app was not killed by user, it is woke up and state changed to UIApplicationStateInactive.

Dependency Inversion PrincipleIn the first example, Hank Pym is dependent on the concrete implementation of the Suit In the second example, both Hank Pym and the suits are dependent on the Suit protocol. This way Hank Pym only knows about the Suit protocol, and future suits must be crafted to that it conforms to the Suit protocol This way the dependency is inverted High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions. What is the high level policy? It is the abstractions that underlie the application, thetruths that do not vary when the details are changed Inversion of Control ContainerYou may ask yourself Why is Inversion of Control named that way?

The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself You will NOT make 40 thousand dollars a year right out of high school. You won’t be a vice president with car phone, until you earn both. If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss. He doesn’t have tenure. If you mess up, it’s not your parents’ fault, so don’t whine about your mistakes, learn from them. Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life may not. In some schools they have abolished failing grades and they’ll give you as many times as you want to get the right answer. This doesn’t bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life. Life is not divided into semesters. You don’t get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself. Do that on your own time. Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs. Be nice to nerds. Chances are you’ll end up working for one. Before you were born your parents weren’t as boring as they are now. They got that way paying your bills, cleaning up your room and listening to you tell them how idealistic you are.
