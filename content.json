They tweet cool things about tech and life. I learned a lot. Please don‚Äôt show me the evil sides of the world ~ Michael Learn To Rock - How Many Hours But there‚Äôs also bad side of the story. I see many retweets of people saying bad things about others, mostly in form of Ad Hominem Attacking the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself, when the attack on the person is completely irrelevant to the argument the person is making. From Ad Hominem on c2.com An argumentum ad hominem is any kind of argument that criticizes an idea by pointing something out about the people who hold the idea rather than directly addressing the merits of the idea. ‚Äò‚ÄôAd hominem‚Äô‚Äô is Latin for ‚Äúdirected toward the man (as opposed to the issue at hand)‚Äù. An alternative expression is ‚Äúplaying the man and not the ball‚Äù. Most of these people have the Twitter verified badge. They complain that they have so many followers while they themselves follow hundreds of thousands. They say bad things about others‚Äô hair style and appearance while actively supporting equality. They argue who owns the original gif. They follow one person just to be the first to insult them. The blue verified badge on Twitter lets people know that an account of public interest is authentic.

If your app isn‚Äôt installed, tapping a link to your website opens your website in Safari. Web Markup Mark Up Web Content If some or all of your app‚Äôs content is also available on your website, you can use web markup to give users access to your content in search results. Using web markup lets the Applebot web crawler index your content in Apple‚Äôs server-side index, which makes it available to all iOS users in Spotlight and Safari search results. Shared Web Credentials Shared Web Credentials Reference Shared web credentials is a programming interface that enables native iOS apps to share credentials with their website counterparts. For example, a user may log in to a website in Safari, entering a user name and password, and save those credentials using the iCloud Keychain. Later, the user may run a native app from the same developer, and instead of the app requiring the user to reenter a user name and password, shared web credentials gives it access to the credentials that were entered earlier in Safari.

We should store them on 1Password and populate our gradle.properties, so don‚Äôt track this file in git. Here is .gitignore file 12345678*.iml/build/gradle.properties/local.properties.gradle.idea There are several ways to help BuddyBuild know about our gradle.properties 1. Using Environment variablesBut when configuring the project on BuddyBuild, it complains about key not found. The solution is to use Environment variables Then in your build.gradle, you can 1buildConfigField 'String', 'MY_KEY', System.getenv(&quot;MY_KEY&quot;) ?: MY_KEY This is because gradle does not know about environment variables. The System.getenv(&quot;MY_KEY&quot;) is for BuddyBuild, and the default MY_KEY is for gradle.properties. Next is to remove this duplication. We can use Groovy Binding. build.gradle does the import import groovy.lang.Binding automatically for us 12345678String environmentKey(variable) { for (Object var : binding.variables) { if (var.value == variable) { return System.getenv(var.key) ?: variable } } return \"\"} 1buildConfigField 'String', 'MY_KEY', environmentKey(MY_KEY) 2. Using Secured File üëçBuddyBuild allows us to define Secured File, here we can upload our gradle.properties And we can use Prebuild script to copy this secured file to our project. BuddyBuild suggests using buddybuild_prebuild.sh but then build fails in Build file '/tmp/sandbox/workspace/app/build.gradle' So, create a script called buddybuild_postclone.sh 123#!/usr/bin/env bashcp $BUDDYBUILD_SECURE_FILES/gradle.properties $BUDDYBUILD_WORKSPACE/gradle.properties","link":"/blog/BuddyBuild-and-gradle.properties/"},{"title":"Check before you commit","text":"Issue #7 Original post https://medium.com/@onmyway133/check-before-you-commit-5a7601cffc87 We usually have some experiment code that we don‚Äôt want they to step into our commit.

The other day we had a strange bug that was only occurring in production build, and in iOS only. A long backtrace in the app revealed that it was due to Date constructor failure. const date = new Date(&quot;2019-01-18 12:00:00&quot;)This returns the correct Date object in debug mode, but yields Invalid Date in release. What‚Äôs special about Date constructor? Here I‚Äôm using react native 0.57.5 and no Date libraries. Date constructorThe best resource for learning Javascript is via Mozilla web docs, and entering Date: Creates a JavaScript Date instance that represents a single moment in time. Date objects use a Unix Time Stamp, an integer value that is the number of milliseconds since 1 January 1970 UTC. Pay attention to how Date can be constructed by dateString: dateStringString value representing a date. The string should be in a format recognized by the Date.parse() method (IETF-compliant RFC 2822 timestamps and also a version of ISO8601). So Date constructor uses static method Date.parse under the hood. This has very specific requirement about the format of date string that it supports The standard string representation of a date time string is a simplification of the ISO 8601 calendar date extended format (see Date Time String Format section in the ECMAScript specification for more details). For example, ‚Äú2011-10-10‚Äù (date-only form), ‚Äú2011-10-10T14:48:00‚Äù (date-time form), or ‚Äú2011-10-10T14:48:00.000+09:00‚Äù (date-time form with milliseconds and time zone) can be passed and will be parsed. When the time zone offset is absent, date-only forms are interpreted as a UTC time and date-time forms are interpreted as local time.The ECMAScript specification states: If the String does not conform to the standard format the function may fall back to any implementation‚Äìspecific heuristics or implementation‚Äìspecific parsing algorithm. Unrecognizable strings or dates containing illegal element values in ISO formatted strings shall cause Date.parse() to return NaN. The reason that we get Invalid Date in iOS must be because the code was run in two different JavaScript environments and they somehow have different implementation of the Date parsing function. JavaScript EnvironmentReact Native guide has a dedicated section about JavaScript environments. When using React Native, you‚Äôre going to be running your JavaScript code in two environments: In most cases, React Native will use JavaScriptCore, the JavaScript engine that powers Safari. Note that on iOS, JavaScriptCore does not use JIT due to the absence of writable executable memory in iOS apps. When using Chrome debugging, all JavaScript code runs within Chrome itself, communicating with native code via WebSockets. Chrome uses V8 as its JavaScript engine. While both environments are very similar, you may end up hitting some inconsistencies. We‚Äôre likely going to experiment with other JavaScript engines in the future, so it‚Äôs best to avoid relying on specifics of any runtime. React Native also uses Babel and some polyfills to have some nice syntax transformers, so some of the code that we write may not be necessarily supported natively by JavascriptCore. Now it is clear that while we debug our app via Chrome debugger, it works because V8 engine handles that. Now try turning off Remote JS Debugging: we can see that the above Date constructor fails, which means it is using JavascriptCore. To confirm this issue, let‚Äôs run our app in Xcode and go to the Safari app on MacOS to enter Development menu. Select the active Simulator and choose JSContext on the current iOS app. Remember to turn off Remote JS Debugging so that the app uses JavascriptCore: Now open the Console in Safari dev tools, and we should have access to JavascriptCore inside our app. Try running the above Date constructor to confirm that it fails: What are legit date string formats?Since 2016, JavascriptCore supports most ES6 features: As of r202125, JavaScriptCore supports all of the new features in the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) language specification And it was fully confirmed a year later in JSC üíï ES6 ES2015 (also known as ES6), the version of the JavaScript specification ratified in 2015, is a huge improvement to the language‚Äôs expressive power thanks to features like classes, for-of, destructuring, spread, tail calls, and much moreWebKit‚Äôs JavaScript implementation, called JSC (JavaScriptCore), implements all of ES6 For more details about JavaScript features supported by different JavaScript engines, visit this ECMAScript comparison table. Now for the date string format, from Date.parse, let‚Äôs visit ECMAScript 2015 specification to see what it says about date string format: ECMAScript defines a string interchange format for date-times based upon a simplification of the ISO 8601 Extended Format. The format is as follows: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ Where the fields are as follows: ‚ÄúT‚Äù appears literally in the string, to indicate the beginning of the time element. So JavascriptCore requires T specifier and V8 can work without it. The fix for now is to always include that T specifier. This way we always follow ECMAScript standards to make sure it works across different JavaScript environments. const date = new Date(&quot;2019-01-18 12:00:00&quot;.replace(&apos; &apos;, &apos;T&apos;))And now it returns correct Date object. There may be difference between JavascriptCore on iOS and macOS, and among different iOS versions. The lesson learned here is that we should always test our app thoroughly in production and on devices to make sure it works as expected.","link":"/blog/Get-to-know-different-JavaScript-environments-in-React-Native/"},{"title":"Dealing with CSS responsiveness in Wordpress","text":"Issue #208 During the alpha test of LearnTalks, some of my friends reported that the screen is completely blank in the search page, and this happened in mobile only. This article is how I identify the problem and found a workaround for the issue, it may not be the solution, but at least the screen does not appear blank anymore. As someone who likes to keep up with tech via watching conference videos, I thought it might be a good idea to collect all of these to better search and explore later. So I built a web app with React and Firebase, it is a work in progress for now. Due to time constraints, I decided to go first with Wordpress to quickly play with the idea. So there is LearnTalks. The theme Marinate that I used didn‚Äôt want to render the search page correctly. So I head over to Chrome Dev Tool for Responsive Viewport Mode and Safari for Web Inspector The tests showed that the problem only happened on certain screen resolutions.

And somehow it didn‚Äôt work for some sizes. 12345@media screen and (max-width: 800px) { #site-header { display: none; }} A bit about the rulesThe @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices.

Medium also lists my comments as stories, which is kind of üò≤ I like to write fast, and with good comments system, and I love Markdown. I like GitHub. I use GitHub for my notes, so I think I will use it for my blog as well. Hope all these GitHub convenience will encourage me to write more often. This will, of course, be less discoverable by people.

SwiftUI has good diffing so we just need to update our models so the whole content will be diffed and rendered again. 123456789101112var body: some View { List { ForEach(blogs) { blog in VStack { Text(blog.name) } .onTap { print(\"cell was tapped\") } } }} SwiftUI style with diffingI built DeepDiff before and it was used by many people. Now I‚Äôm pleased to introduce Micro which is a SwiftU style with DeepDiff powered so it performs fast diffing whenever state changes. With Micro we can just use the familiar forEach to declare Cell, and the returned State will tell DataSource to update the UICollectionView. Every time state is assigned, UICollectionView will be fast diffed and reloaded. The only requirement is that your model should conform to DiffAware with diffId so DeepDiff knows how to diff for changes. 1234567891011121314151617let dataSource = DataSource(collectionView: collectionView)dataSource.state = State { ForEach(blogs) { blog in Cell&lt;BlogCell&gt;() { context, cell in cell.nameLabel.text = blog.name } .onSelect { context in print(\"cell at index \\(context.indexPath.item) is selected\") } .onSize { context in CGSize( width: context.collectionView.frame.size.width, height: 40 ) } }} DataSource is completely overridable, if you want to customize any methods, just subclass DataSource, override methods and access its state.models 123456class CustomDataSource: DataSource { override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) { let blog = state.models[indexPath.item] as?

The packet size depends on many different variables, so there is no great answer for an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù packet size ‚Äì average depends on the environment. Just as an example, if you currently have VoIP running within a LAN and want to provision a new WAN so you can use VoIP to another site, knowing how big your VoIP packets are on the LAN won‚Äôt help. See below for a VoIP packet size calculation for a typical LAN, which will get you started. Packet sizeThe general formula for VoIP packet size is this 1Frame overhead + Encapsulation overhead + IP overhead + Voice payload. Let‚Äôs say the packet is going across our LAN, so right now the frame overhead is 18 Bytes, for Ethernet II. (This size would change later if the packet crosses a trunk with 802.1Q tagging or ISL encapsulation, or is destined for the WAN, where a different link layer framing will probably be in use.) EncapsulationEncapsulation overhead would include things like IPSec tunnels for security. Suppose we are not encapsulating this voice packet, so there is no overhead here. ‚ÄúIP overhead‚Äù has overhead occurring at layer 3 and above, so for SIP phones this means IP (20 Bytes), UDP (8 Bytes), and RTP (12 Bytes). This is a total of 40 Bytes of IP overhead. Lastly, you must calculate the size of the actual voice payload. Suppose we use the G.711 codec, which gives us a codec bandwidth of 64kbps. Also suppose our phones have a packetisation period of 20ms (meaning 20ms worth of voice goes into every packet). With these two numbers, we can figure out the size of the voice payload. Since one second of voice contains 64 kilobits of data (‚Äú64 kbps‚Äù), it is easy to calculate how many bits Find the amount of Bytes per payload: 1264000 bits * .02 seconds = 1280 bits of voice per payload 1280 bits / 8 bits per byte = 160 Bytes of voice per payload The total overhead is 58 Bytes (18 + 40)The total VoIP packet size is 218 Bytes (160 + 58 ) In the interest of full disclosure, it is easy to get a bit rate per second from here; just convert 218 Bytes into bits and multiply by the packetization rate (which is the inverse of your packetization period, in this case 50 packets per second). The bit rate for ONE stream of this voice is 87.2kbps‚Ä¶ we hope the user isn‚Äôt just talking to himself, so double that for an actual phone conversation. There are lots of other little things, like VAD and various header compressions, that you may need to factor into these calculations as well. As you can see, any one of these many things being off will give you a different answer, so knowing how to go about the entire process is important.

As someone who likes to keep up with tech via watching conference videos, I thought it might be a good idea to collect all of these to better search and explore later. So I built a web app with React and Firebase, it is a work in progress for now. Due to time constraints, I decided to go first with Wordpress to quickly play with the idea. So there is LearnTalks. The theme Marinate that I used didn‚Äôt want to render the search page correctly. So I head over to Chrome Dev Tool for Responsive Viewport Mode and Safari for Web Inspector The tests showed that the problem only happened on certain screen resolutions. This must be due to CSS @media query which display different layouts for different screen sizes. And somehow it didn‚Äôt work for some sizes. [@media](http://twitter.com/media) screen and (max-width: 800px) { #site-header { display: none; } }A bit about the rulesThe @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices. Media queries can be used to check many things, such as: width and height of the viewport width and height of the device orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?) resolution Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet (responsive web design) to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. So I go to Wordpress Dashboard -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Editor to examine CSS files. Unsurprisingly, there are a bunch of media queries [@media](http://twitter.com/media) (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 767px) { .main-navigation { padding: 0; } .site-header .pushmenu { margin-top:0px; } .social-networks li a { line-height:2.1em !Important; } .search { display: none !important; } .customer blockquote { padding: 10px; text-align: justify; } }The .search selector is suspicious display: none !important; The important directive is, well, quite important It means, essentially, what it says; that ‚Äòthis is important, ignore subsequent rules, and any usual specificity issues, apply this rule!‚ÄôIn normal use a rule defined in an external stylesheet is overruled by a style defined in the head of the document, which, in turn, is overruled by an in-line style within the element itself (assuming equal specificity of the selectors). Defining a rule with the !important ‚Äòattribute‚Äô (?) discards the normal concerns as regards the ‚Äòlater‚Äô rule overriding the ‚Äòearlier‚Äô ones. Luckily, this theme allows the ability to Edit CSS , so I can override that to a block attribute to always show search page","link":"/blog/How-to-deal-with-CSS-responsiveness-in-Wordpress/"},{"title":"How to deal with NODE_MODULE_VERSION in electron","text":"Issue #69 NODE_MODULE_VERSIONToday I was trying to install sharp with yarn add sharp to work in my electron app, but I get the following error Uncaught Error: The module ‚Äò/Users/khoa/MyElectronApp/node_modules/sharp/build/Release/sharp.node‚Äôwas compiled against a different Node.js version usingNODE_MODULE_VERSION 57.

The other day, I was practise making Signal based on this talk UIKonf 2015 - Jens Ravens: Functional Reactive Programming without Black Magic Take a look at my repo Signal filterI was making a filter for a Signal. The idea of filter is that we should update signal if the Event is Next with right filtered value Signal.swift 12345678910111213public func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt;{ let signal = Signal&lt;T&gt;() subscribe { result in switch(result) { case let .Success(value): if f(value) { signal.update(result) } case let .Error(error): signal.update(.Error(error)) } } return signal} 2 paramsBut having Event as another monad, I think it should be more encapsulated if that switching logic gets moved into the Event. Here the filter takes 2 params Event.swift 12345678910func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool, callback: (Event&lt;T&gt; -&gt; Void)) { switch self { case let .Next(value) where f(value): callback(self) case .Failed: callback(self) default: break }} Signal.swift 123456789public func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt; { let signal = Signal&lt;T&gt;() subscribe { event in event.filter(f, callback: signal.update) } return signal} CurryingWith currying, we can make filter a more abstract function, and defer the decision to pass the callback param. It is a little carried away but I find it helpful this way Now filter accepts 1 param, and it returns a function that takes callback as its param Event.swift 123456789101112func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; ((Event&lt;T&gt; -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) { return { g in switch self { case let .Next(value) where f(value): g(self) case .Failed: g(self) default: break } } } Signal.swift 123456789public func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt; { let signal = Signal&lt;T&gt;() subscribe { event in event.filter(f)(signal.update) } return signal } Curry syntax in Swift 2Swift 2 supports curry syntax function 1234567func sum(a: Int)(b: Int) -&gt; Int { return a + b}let sumWith5 = sum(5)let result = sumWith5(b: 10) No more curry syntax in Swift 3You may want to find out Bidding farewell to currying Reference Higher order functions What is the advantage of currying?

The animations you create using this protocol must not be interactive. To create interactive transitions, you must combine your animator object with another object that controls the timing of your animations. Implement this method when you want to perform your transitions using an interruptible animator object, such as a UIViewPropertyAnimator object. You must return the same animator object for the duration of the transition. For more fine-grained control, we can have UIPresentationController From the time a view controller is presented until the time it is dismissed, UIKit uses a presentation controller to manage various aspects of the presentation process for that view controller. The presentation controller can add its own animations on top of those provided by animator objects, it can respond to size changes, and it can manage other aspects of how the view controller is presented onscreen. A lazy approach is to present without animation and do animation after 1234present(detailViewController, animated: false, completion: { let animator = UIViewPropertyAnimator() animator.startAnimation()}) If we don‚Äôt want to involve UIViewController then we can work on UIView level. This way we can animate hiding tab bar.

There will always be debug.xcconfig and release.xcconfig for each of your project target. If your project MyApp has a production target called MyApp Production and MyApp Staging, then you should have these files 1234Pods-MyApp Staging.debug.xcconfigPods-MyApp Staging.release.xcconfigPods-MyApp Production.debug.xcconfigPods-MyApp Production.release.xcconfig These are added to projects but not checked to any targets.

The issue was that the status bar always orients to device orientation despite I already locked my main ViewController to portrait. This was why I started notes project on GitHub detailing what issues I ‚Äòve been facing.ViewController is locked to portrait but the status bar rotates when device rotates ¬∑ Issue #2 ¬∑‚Ä¶PROBLEM The rootViewController is locked to portrait. When I rotates, the view controller is portrait, but the status‚Ä¶github.com Now it is iOS 12, and to my surprise people still have this issues. Today I will revise this issue in iOS 12 project and use Swift. Supported interface orientationsMost apps only support portrait mode, with 1 or 2 screens being in landscape for image viewing or video player. So we usually declare Portrait, Landscape Left and Landscape Right. Since iOS 7, apps have simple design with focus on content. UIViewController was given bigger role in appearance specification. Supposed that we have a MainViewController as the rootViewController and we want this to be locked in portrait mode. [@UIApplicationMain](http://twitter.com/UIApplicationMain) class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate { var window: UIWindow? func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -&gt; Bool { window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds) window?.rootViewController = MainViewController() window?.makeKeyAndVisible() return true } }There is a property called UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance that we can specify in Info.plist to assert that we want UIViewController to dynamically control status bar appearance. A Boolean value indicating whether the status bar appearance is based on the style preferred for the current view controller. Start by declaring in Info.plist &lt;key&gt;UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt;And in MainViewController , lock status bar to portrait import UIKit class MainViewController: UIViewController { let label = UILabel() override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() view.backgroundColor = .yellow label.textColor = .red label.text = &quot;MainViewController&quot; label.font = UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .headline) label.sizeToFit() view.addSubview(label) } override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() { super.viewDidLayoutSubviews() label.center = CGPoint(x: view.bounds.size.width/2, y: view.bounds.size.height/2) } override var supportedInterfaceOrientations: UIInterfaceOrientationMask { return .portrait } }The idea is that no matter orientation the device is, the status bar always stays in portrait mode, the same as our MainViewController . But to my surprise, this is not the case !!! As you can see in the screenshot below, the MainViewController is in portrait, but the status bar is not. Stop mixing code and StoryboardIt took me a while to figure out that while I declare UIWindow in code, I also have MainStoryboard that configures UIWindow &lt;key&gt;UIMainStoryboardFile&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;Main&lt;/string&gt;And this UIWindow from Storyboard has a default root ViewController import UIKit class ViewController: UIViewController { override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() } }The meaning of UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearanceIn iOS, the status bar is hidden in landscape by default. Setting UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance to false means that we want this default behaviour Setting UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance to true means we want to have control over the status bar appearance. So to hide the status bar, we must override prefersStatusBarHidden in the rootViewController, the presented view controller or the full screen view controller As you can see, the problem is that the ViewController from UIWindow in Storyboard clashes with our MainViewController in code, hence a lot of confusion. The solution is simple, remove Main.storyboard and don‚Äôt use that in project &lt;key&gt;UIMainStoryboardFile&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;Main&lt;/string&gt;Now we get our desired behaviour, status bar and view controllers are always locked to portrait regardless of the device orientation. If you use code like me to setup UI, remember to clean up the generated storyboard and ViewController that comes default when project was generated by Xcode.","link":"/blog/How-to-fix-wrong-status-bar-orientation-in-iOS/"},{"title":"How to enable NSMenuItem in AppKit","text":"Issue #428 Need to set target 1234567let item = NSMenuItem( title: title, action: #selector(onMenuItemClicked(_:)), keyEquivalent: \"\")item.target = self Sometimes, need to check autoenablesItems Indicates whether the menu automatically enables and disables its menu items.

These are both convenient but confusing at first, but if we use it more, it will make more sense and hopefully we can learn to do the same for our own property wrappers","link":"/blog/How-to-get-Binding-via-dollar-prefix-in-SwiftUI/"},{"title":"How to get trending repos on GitHub using Retrofit","text":"Issue #367 1https://api.github.com/search/repositories?sort=stars&amp;order=desc&amp;q=language:javascript,java,swift,kotlin&amp;q=created:&gt;2019-08-21 12345678interface Api { @GET(\"https://api.github.com/search/repositories\") suspend fun getTrendingRepos( @Query(\"sort\") sort: String, @Query(\"order\") order: String, @Query(\"q\") qs: List&lt;String&gt; ): Response} 12345678910class Repo { fun api(): Api { return Retrofit.Builder() .baseUrl(\"https://api.github.com/\") .addConverterFactory(MoshiConverterFactory.create()) .build() .create(Api::class.java) }} 123456789101112131415161718192021class ViewModel(val repo: Repo, val dateProvider: DateProvider): ViewModel() { val items = MutableLiveData&lt;ArrayList&lt;Item&gt;&gt;() suspend fun load() { try { val order = \"desc\" val sort = \"star\" val formatter = SimpleDateFormat(\"YYYY-MM-dd\") val qs = listOf( \"language:javascript,java,swift,kotlin\", \"q=created:&gt;${formatter.format(dateProvider.yesterday)}\" ) val response = repo.api().getTrendingRepos(sort=sort, order=order, qs=qs) this.items.value = response.items.toCollection(ArrayList()) } catch (e: Exception) { this.items.value = arrayListOf() } }}","link":"/blog/How-to-get-trending-repos-on-GitHub-using-Retrofit/"},{"title":"How to generate xml in Swift","text":"Issue #556 Instead of learning XMLParser, we can make a lightweight version 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465666768697071727374757677787980818283848586878889909192import Foundationpublic protocol XmlItem { func toLines() -&gt; [String]}public struct XmlString: XmlItem { public let key: String public let value: String public init(key: String, value: String) { self.key = key self.value = value } public func toLines() -&gt; [String] { return [ \"&lt;key&gt;\\(key)&lt;/key&gt;\", \"&lt;string&gt;\\(value)&lt;/string&gt;\" ] as [String] }}public struct XmlBool: XmlItem { public let key: String public let value: Bool public init(key: String, value: Bool) { self.key = key self.value = value } public func toLines() -&gt; [String] { let string = value ?

This is more convenient to do in Storyboard (although very hard to reason about), but if we‚Äôre doing in code (my prefer way), then it is a lot of code. And a lot of code means a lot of bugs. If you take a look at iOSRes, we see the ratio 16:9 (height:width) iPhone SE (320 x 568): 1.775 iPhone 6 (375 x 667): 1.778 iPhone 6+ (414 x 736): 1.778 They mostly have the same ratio. So we can have a simple approach, that scale elements based on ratio. Given the fact that the designer usually designs for iPhone 6 size, we can make that a base. In this approach, the content will scale up or down depending on its ratio. You may argue that the idea of bigger phone is to display more, not to show the same content bigger. You may be right, in that case you need to create different constraints and different UIs. But if you want simple solutions that work, this is one of them This is the technique I used when doing Windows Phone development, but it applies to many platforms as well Calculate the ratio12345678class Device { // Base width in point, use iPhone 6 static let base: CGFloat = 375 static var ratio: CGFloat { return UIScreen.main.bounds.width / base }} Extension to make it convenientWe can have a computed property called adjusted that adjusts the size based on the ratio 1234567891011121314151617181920extension CGFloat { var adjusted: CGFloat { return self * Device.ratio }}extension Double { var adjusted: CGFloat { return CGFloat(self) * Device.ratio }}extension Int { var adjusted: CGFloat { return CGFloat(self) * Device.ratio }} Use the ratioYou can adjust as much as you want 123456label.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 23.adjusted)phoneTextField.leftAnchor.constraint(equalTo: container.leftAnchor, constant: 30.adjusted),phoneTextField.rightAnchor.constraint(equalTo: container.rightAnchor, constant: -30.adjusted),imageView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 80.adjusted), imageView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 90.adjusted),","link":"/blog/How-to-handle-Auto-Layout-with-different-screen-sizes/"},{"title":"How to handle RefreshControl in iOS","text":"Issue #20 The other day I was doing refresh control, and I saw this Swift Protocols with Default Implementations as UI Mixins 1234567891011121314151617181920extension Refreshable where Self: UIViewController{ /// Install the refresh control on the table view func installRefreshControl() { let refreshControl = UIRefreshControl() refreshControl.tintColor = .primaryColor refreshControl.addTarget(self, action: #selector(handleRefresh(_:)), for: .valueChanged) self.refreshControl = refreshControl if #available(iOS 10.0, *) { tableView.refreshControl = refreshControl } else { tableView.backgroundView = refreshControl } }} Protocol extension is cool but somehow I‚Äôm not a fan of it.

In most cases the best locale to choose is ‚Äúen_US_POSIX‚Äù, a locale that‚Äôs specifically designed to yield US English results regardless of both user and system preferences. ‚Äúen_US_POSIX‚Äù is also invariant in time (if the US, at some point in the future, changes the way it formats dates, ‚Äúen_US‚Äù will change to reflect the new behaviour, but ‚Äúen_US_POSIX‚Äù will not), and between machines (‚Äúen_US_POSIX‚Äù works the same on iOS as it does on OS X, and as it it does on other platforms).

I did XAML in Visual Studio for Windows Phone apps and XML in Android Studio for Android apps some time ago, and I had good experience. However since I‚Äôm used to writing things in code, I like to do the same for Unity games, although the Unity editor and simulator are pretty good. Besides being comfortable declaring things in code, I find that code is easy to diff and organise. I also learn more how components work, because in Unity editor, most of important the components and properties are already wired and set up for us, so there‚Äôs some very obvious things that we don‚Äôt know. All the things we can do in the editor, we can express in code. Things like setting up components, transform anchor, animation, sound, ‚Ä¶ are all feasible in code and you only need to using the correct namespace. There‚Äôs lots of info at Welcome to the Unity Scripting Reference. Unity 2018 has Visual Studio Community so that‚Äôs pretty comfortable to write code. Javascript and CI would be extremely happy if Unity supports Kotlin or Swift, but for now only Javascript and C# are supported. I‚Äôm also a huge fan of pure Javascript, but I choose C# because of type safety, and also because C# was the language I studied at university for XNA and ASP.NET projects. IndentationIf you like 2 spaces indentation like me, you can go to Preferences in Visual Studio to change the editor settings GameObject and CanvasIn the Unity editor, try dragging an arbitrary UI element onto the screen, you can see that a Canvas and EventSystem are also created. These are GameObject that has a bunch of predefined Component . If we were to write this in code, we just need to follow the what is on the screen. In the beginning, we must use the editor to learn objects and properties, but later if we are familiar with Unity and its many GameObject , we can just code. Bear with me, it can be a hassle with code at first, but you surely learn a lot. I usually organise reusable code into files, let‚Äôs create a C# file and name it Sugar .

Dependency InjectionThe technique we just saw is called Dependency Injection, in which Hank Pym does not need to create the Suit, it will be provided through constructor or property. Dependency Inversion PrincipleIn the first example, Hank Pym is dependent on the concrete implementation of the Suit In the second example, both Hank Pym and the suits are dependent on the Suit protocol. This way Hank Pym only knows about the Suit protocol, and future suits must be crafted to that it conforms to the Suit protocol This way the dependency is inverted High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions. What is the high level policy? It is the abstractions that underlie the application, thetruths that do not vary when the details are changed Inversion of Control ContainerYou may ask yourself Why is Inversion of Control named that way?

And by CollectionView, I actually mean UICollectionView üòâ . Most of the time, we show something with response from backend, then potentially update and insert new items as data changed. We can totally call reloadData to reflect the changes, but an animation is better here as it gives user better understanding of what‚Äôs going on, and to not surprise them. This talks about UICollectionView, but UITableView behaves the same Drag and DropLet‚Äôs imagine an app where user are allowed to customise their experience by moving items from one collection to another. You can take a look at the example DragAndDrop which is using the new drag and drop API in iOS 11. You must ensure that your data is changed before calling update methods on UICollectionView. And then we call deleteItems and insertItems to reflect data changes. UICollectionView performs a nice animation for you 12345678910111213func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, performDropWith coordinator: UICollectionViewDropCoordinator) { let destinationIndexPath = coordinator.destinationIndexPath let sourceIndexPath = coordinator.items.last?.dragItem.localObject as! IndexPath // remove sourceItems.remove(at: sourceIndexPath.item) sourceCollectionView.deleteItems(at: [sourceIndexPath]) // insert destinationItems.insert(draggedItem, at: destinationIndexPath.item) destinationCollectionView.insertItems(at: [destinationIndexPath])} NSInternalInconsistencyExceptionIf you have large number of items with many insertions and deletions from backend response, you need to calculate the correct IndexPath to call, which are not easy thing. Most the time you will get the following crashes Terminating app due to uncaught exception ‚ÄòNSInternalInconsistencyException‚Äô,reason: ‚ÄòInvalid update: invalid number of items in section 0.The number of items contained in an existing section after the update (213)must be equal to the number of items contained in that section beforethe update (154), plus or minus the number of items inserted ordeleted from that section (40 inserted, 0 deleted) and plusor minus the number of items moved into or out ofthat section (0 moved in, 0 moved out).‚Äô In my experience it happened randomly because everyone has different data. Although the message is very descriptive, it may take a while to figure it out. Game of IndexPathLet‚Äôs refine our knowledge of IndexPath by going through some examples. With a collection of 6 items, we perform some update operations and figure out what IndexPath should be. 1items = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\"] Take a look at my example here CollectionUpdateExample, there are many more examples index vs offsetBefore we go any further, I just want to mention that, by index I actually mean offset from the start. If you take a look at the enumerated function, it suggests the name as offset instead of index 123Array(0..&lt;10).enumerated().forEach { (offset, element) in} This zero based numbering could shed some light on this matter Particularly in C, where arrays are closely tied to pointer arithmetic, this makes for a simpler implementation: the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array, so the first element has an offset of zero. 1. Insert 3 items at the end123456items.append(contentsOf: [\"g\", \"h\", \"i\"])// a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, ilet indexPaths = Array(6...8).map { IndexPath(item: $0, section: 0) }collectionView.insertItems(at: indexPaths) 2.

Delete 3 items at the beginning, then insert 3 items at the endWith multiple different operations, we should use performBatchUpdates You can use this method in cases where you want to make multiple changes to the collection view in one single animated operation, as opposed to in several separate animations. You might use this method to insert, delete, reload, or move cells or use it to change the layout parameters associated with one or more cells 123456789101112131415items.removeFirst()items.removeFirst()items.removeFirst()items.append(contentsOf: [\"g\", \"h\", \"i\"])// d, e, f, g, h, icollectionView.performBatchUpdates({ let deleteIndexPaths = Array(0...2).map { IndexPath(item: $0, section: 0) } collectionView.deleteItems(at: deleteIndexPaths) let insertIndexPaths = Array(3...5).map { IndexPath(item: $0, section: 0) } collectionView.insertItems(at: insertIndexPaths)}, completion: nil) 6.

If you take a look at the documentation Deletes are processed before inserts in batch operations. This means the indexes for the deletions are processed relative to the indexes of the collection view‚Äôs state before the batch operation, and the indexes for the insertions are processed relative to the indexes of the state after all the deletions in the batch operation. No matter how we call insert or delete, performBatchUpdates always performs deletions first. So we need to call deleteItems and insertItems as if the deletions occur first. 123456789101112131415items.append(contentsOf: [\"g\", \"h\", \"i\"])items.removeFirst()items.removeFirst()items.removeFirst()// d, e, f, g, h, icollectionView.performBatchUpdates({ let deleteIndexPaths = Array(0...2).map { IndexPath(item: $0, section: 0) } collectionView.deleteItems(at: deleteIndexPaths) let insertIndexPaths = Array(3...5).map { IndexPath(item: $0, section: 0) } collectionView.insertItems(at: insertIndexPaths)}, completion: nil) OperationsThere are many operations on UICollectionView, and there are operations to update whole section as well. Take a look Ordering of Operations and Index Paths 12345insertItems(at indexPaths: [IndexPath])deleteItems(at indexPaths: [IndexPath])reloadItems(at indexPaths: [IndexPath])moveItem(at indexPath: IndexPath, to newIndexPath: IndexPath)performBatchUpdates(_ updates, completion) 1234insertSections(_ sections: IndexSet)deleteSections(_ sections: IndexSet)reloadSections(_ sections: IndexSet)moveSection(_ section: Int, toSection newSection: Int) Edit distanceDoing these calculations by hand is quite tedious and error prone. We can build our own abstraction using some algorithms. The naive one is Wagner‚ÄìFischer algorithm which uses Dynamic Programming to tell the edit distance between two strings of characters. Edit distance means the number of steps needed to change from one string to another. String is just a collection of characters, so we can generalise this concept to make it work for any collection of items. Instead of comparing character, we require items to conform to Equatable ‚Äúkit‚Äù -&gt; ‚Äúkat‚ÄùHow can we transform form the word ‚Äúkit‚Äù to ‚Äúkat‚Äù? What kinds of operations do we nede to perform? You may tell ‚Äújust change the i to a‚Äù, but this trivial example helps you understand the algorithm. Let‚Äôs get started. DeletionsIf we go from ‚Äúkit‚Äù to an empty string ‚Äú‚Äù, we need 3 deletions ‚Äúk‚Äù -&gt; ‚Äú‚Äù üëâ 1 deletion‚Äúki‚Äù -&gt; ‚Äú‚Äù üëâ 2 deletions‚Äúkit‚Äù -&gt; ‚Äú‚Äù üëâ 3 deletions InsertionsIf we go from an empty string ‚Äú‚Äù to ‚Äúkat‚Äù, we need 3 insertions ‚Äú‚Äù -&gt; ‚Äúk‚Äù üëâ 1 insertion‚Äú‚Äù -&gt; ‚Äúka‚Äù üëâ 2 insertions‚Äú‚Äù -&gt; ‚Äúkat‚Äù üëâ 3 insertions If equal, take value from the top leftYou can think of the algorithm as if we go from source string, to empty string, to destination string. We try to find the minimum steps to update. Going horizontally means insertions, vertically means deletions and diagonally means substitutions This way we can build our matrix, iterate from row to row, column by column. First, the letter ‚Äúk‚Äù from source collection is the same with letter ‚Äúk‚Äù from destination collection, we simply take value from the top left, which is 0 substituion If not equalWe continue with the next letter from the destination collection. Here ‚Äúk‚Äù and ‚Äúa‚Äù are not the same. We take minimum value from left, top, top left. Then increase by one Here we take value from left, which is horizontally, so we increase by 1 insertion ‚Äúk‚Äù -&gt; ‚Äúkat‚Äù üëâ 2 insertionsContinue, they are not the same, so we take value from left horizontally. Here you can see it kind makes sense, as to go from ‚Äúk‚Äù to ‚Äúkat‚Äù, we need 2 insertions, which is to insert letters ‚Äúa‚Äù and ‚Äút‚Äù The bottom right valueContinue with the next row, and next row until we got to the bottom right value, which gives you the edit distance. Here 1 substitution means that we need to perform 1 substitution to go from ‚Äúkit‚Äù to ‚Äúkat‚Äù, which is update ‚Äúi‚Äù with ‚Äúa‚Äô You can easily see that we need to update index 1. But how do we know that it is index 1 ü§î Edit stepsIn each step, we need to associate the index of item in source and destination collection. You can take a look at my implementation DeepDiff ComplexityWe iterate through the matrix, with m and n are the length of source and destination collection respectively, we can see that the complexity of this algorithm is 0(mn). Also the performance greatly depends on the size of the collection and how complex the item is. The more complex and how deep you want to perform Equatable can greatly affect your performance. Improving performanceThe section How does it work shows several ways we can improve performance. Firstly, instead of building a matrix, which costs memory m*n, we can just use temporary arrays as holder. Secondly, to quickly compare 2 items, we can use Hashable, as 2 identical items will always have the same hash. More performanceIf you want better performance, then algorithms with linear complexity may be interested to you.

As someone who worked mostly with development, below are my indispensable apps. They are like suits to Tony Stark. Since I love open source apps, they have higher priority in the list. Open source appsiTerm 2 https://www.iterm2.com/ iTerm2 is a replacement for Terminal and the successor to iTerm. It works on Macs with macOS 10.10 or newer. iTerm2 brings the terminal into the modern age with features you never knew you always wanted. iTerm2 has good integration with tmux and supports Split Panes Term2 allows you to divide a tab into many rectangular ‚Äúpanes‚Äù, each of which is a different terminal session. The shortcuts cmd-d and cmd-shift-d divide an existing session vertically or horizontally, respectively. You can navigate among split panes with cmd-opt-arrow or cmd-[ and cmd-]. You can ‚Äúmaximize‚Äù the current pane ‚Äî hiding all others in that tab ‚Äî with cmd-shift-enter. Pressing the shortcut again restores the hidden panes. There‚Äôs the_silver_searcher with ag command to quickly search for files oh-my-zsh https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh A delightful community-driven (with 1,200+ contributors) framework for managing your zsh configuration. Includes 200+ optional plugins (rails, git, OSX, hub, capistrano, brew, ant, php, python, etc), over 140 themes to spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool so that makes it easy to keep up with the latest updates from the community. I use z shell with oh-my-zsh plugins. I also use zsh-autocompletions to have autocompletion like fish shell and z to track and quickly navigate to the most used directories. spectacle https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle Spectacle allows you to organize your windows without using a mouse. With spectable, I can organise windows easily with just Cmd+Option+F or Cmd+Option+Left insomnia https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia Insomnia is a cross-platform REST client, built on top of Electron. Regardless if you like electron.js apps or not. This is a great tool for testing REST requets Visual Studio Code https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode VS Code is a new type of tool that combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. Code provides comprehensive editing and debugging support, an extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools. This seems to be the most popular for front end development, and many other things. There‚Äôs bunch of extensions that make the experience to a new level. IconGenerator https://github.com/onmyway133/IconGeneratorBuilt by me. When developing iOS, Android and macOS applications, I need a quick way to generate icons in different sizes. You can simply drag the generated asset into Xcode and that‚Äôs it. vmd https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/vmd Preview markdown files in a separate window. Markdown is formatted exactly the same as on GitHub. colorpicker https://github.com/Toinane/colorpicker A mininal but complete colorpicker desktop app I used to use Sip but I often get the problem of losing focus. GifCapture https://github.com/onmyway133/GifCaptureI built this as a native macOS app to capture screen and save to gif file. It works like Licecap but open source. There‚Äôs also an open source tool called kap that is slick. Itsycal https://github.com/sfsam/Itsycal Itsycal is a tiny calendar for your Mac‚Äôs menu bar. The app is minimal and works very well. It can shows calendar for integrated accounts in the mac. PushNotifications https://github.com/onmyway133/PushNotificationsI often need to test push notification to iOS and Android apps. And I want to support both certificate and key p8 authentication for Apple Push Notification service, so I built this tool. Lyrics https://github.com/onmyway133/Lyrics A menu bar app to show the lyric of the playing Spotify song When I listen to some songs in Spotify, I want to see the lyrics too. The lyrics is fetched from https://genius.com/ and displayed in a wonderful UI. gitify https://github.com/manosim/gitify GitHub Notifications on your desktop. I use this to get real time notification for issues and pull requests for projects on GitHub. I hope there is support for Bitbucket soon. FinderGo https://github.com/onmyway133/FinderGoFinderGo is both a native macOS app and a Finder extension. It has toolbar button that opens terminal right within Finder in the current directory. You can configure it to open either Terminal, iTerm2 or Hyper Atom one dark themeThis is about theme. There is the very popular dracular themes, but I find it too strong for the eyes. I don‚Äôt use Atom, but I love its one dark UI. I used to maintain my own theme for Xcode called DarkSide but now I use xcode-one-dark for Xcode and Atom One Dark Theme for Visual Studio Code. I also use Fira Code font in Xcode, Visual Studio Code and Android Studio, which has beautiful ligatures. Chrome extensionsI use Chrome for its speed and wonderful support for extensions. The extensions I made are github-chat to enable chat within GitHub and github-extended to see more pinned repositories. There are also refined github, github-repo-size and octotree that are indispensable for me. caprine https://github.com/sindresorhus/caprine Caprine is an unofficial and privacy focused Facebook Messenger app with many useful features. Close source and commercial appsSublime Text https://www.sublimetext.com/ Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.

Here is a bit of my reflections on curry and how to apply it in Javascript and Swift. Taking one parameter in HaskellIn Haskell, all function officially takes only 1 parameter. Function with many parameters are just curried, which means they will be partially applied. Calling sum 1 just returns a function with 1 parameter, then 2is passed into this function. The following 2 function calls are the same. ghci&gt; sum 1 2 3 ghci&gt; (max 1) 2 3I tend to think of curried function or partially applied function as something that carry dependencies at each application step. Each curried function can be assigned to variable or pass around, or as returned value. Curry in Swift for predicateWhen I was trying to make my own Signal library, I have and Event filterThen there should be a filter for Signal. The idea of filter is that we should update signal if the Event is Next with right filtered value public func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt;{ let signal = Signal&lt;T&gt;() subscribe { result in switch(result) { case let .Success(value): if f(value) { signal.update(result) } case let .Error(error): signal.update(.Error(error)) } } return signal }2 parametersBut having Event as another monad, I think it should be more encapsulated if that switching logic gets moved into the Event. Here the filter takes 2 params Event.swift func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool, callback: (Event&lt;T&gt; -&gt; Void)) { switch self { case let .Next(value) where f(value): callback(self) case .Failed: callback(self) default: break } }Signal.swift public func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt; { let signal = Signal&lt;T&gt;() subscribe { event in event.filter(f, callback: signal.update) } return signal }CurryingWith currying, we can make filter a more abstract function, and defer the decision to pass the callback param. It is a little carried away but I find it helpful this way Now filter accepts 1 param, and it returns a function that takes callback as its param Event.swift func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; ((Event&lt;T&gt; -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) { return { g in switch self { case let .Next(value) where f(value): g(self) case .Failed: g(self) default: break } } }Signal.swift public func filter(f: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt; { let signal = Signal&lt;T&gt;() subscribe { event in event.filter(f)(signal.update) } return signal }Curry syntax in Swift 2 and aboveSwift 2 supports curry syntax function func sum(a: Int)(b: Int) -&gt; Int { return a + b } let sumWith5 = sum(5) let result = sumWith5(b: 10)Unfortunately, the syntactic sugar for declaring curry has been dropped since Swift 3. You may want to find out in Bidding farewell to currying. But it‚Äôs not a big deal as we can easily create curry function. It is just a function that returns another function. Using curry for partial application in UIKitI used this curry technique in my Xkcd app. See MainController.swift. MainController is vanilla UITabBarController with ComicsController and FavoriteController , all embedded in UINavigationViewController . The feature is that when a comic is selected, a comic detail screen should be pushed on top of the navigation stack. For example in ComicsController /// Called when a comic is selected var selectComic: ((Comic) -&gt; Void)?All ComicsController needs to know is to call that selectComic closure with the chosen Comic, and someone should know how to handle that selection. Back to the handleFlow function inside MainController. private func handleFlow() { typealias Function = (UINavigationController) -&gt; (Comic) -&gt; Void let selectComic: Function = { [weak self] navigationController in return { (comic: Comic) in guard let self = self else { return } let detailController = self.makeDetail(comic: comic) navigationController.pushViewController(detailController, animated: true) } } comicsController.selectComic = selectComic(comicNavigationController) favoriteController.selectComic = selectComic(favoriteNavigationController) }I declared Function as typealias to explicitly state the curry function that we are going to build typealias Function = (UINavigationController) -&gt; (Comic) -&gt; VoidWe build selectComic as curried function, that takes UINavigationViewController and returns a function that takes Comic and returns Void . This way when we partially apply selectComic with the a navigationController , we get another function that has navigationController as dependency, and ready to be assigned to selectComic property in comicsController . Curry promised function in JavascriptI like to work with Promise and async/await in Javascript. It allows chainable style and easy to reason about. So when working with callbacks in Javascript, for example callback from native modules in React Native, I tend to convert them into Promise. For example when working with HealthKit, we need to expose a native modules around it // [@flow](http://twitter.com/flow) import { NativeModules } from &apos;react-native&apos; type HealthManagerType = { checkAuthorisation: ((string) =&gt; void)) =&gt; void, authorise: ((boolean) =&gt; void)) =&gt; void, readWorkout: (Date, Date, () =&gt; void)) =&gt; void, readDailySummary: (Date, Date, () =&gt; void)) =&gt; void, readMeasurement: (Date, Date, () =&gt; void)) =&gt; void } const HealthManager: HealthManagerType = NativeModules.HealthManager export default HealthManagerWe can build a toPromise function that can convert a function with callback into Promise // [@flow](http://twitter.com/flow) const toPromise = (f: (any) =&gt; void) =&gt; { return new Promise&lt;any&gt;((resolve, reject) =&gt; { try { f((result) =&gt; { resolve(result) }) } catch (e) { reject(e) } }) } export default toPromiseHowever, as you can see in the signature, it only works with a callback of type (any) =&gt; void In other words, this callback must have exactly 1 parameter, because a Promise can either returns a value or throws an error. To remedy this, we can build a curry function that can turns function with either 1, 2, 3 parameters into curried function. Thanks to the dynamic nature of Javascript, we have // [@flow](http://twitter.com/flow) function curry0(f: () =&gt; void) { return f() } function curry1(f: (any) =&gt; void) { return (p1: any) =&gt; { return f(p1) } } function curry2(f: (any, any) =&gt; void) { return (p1: any) =&gt; { return (p2: any) =&gt; { return f(p1, p2) } } } function curry3(f: (any, any, any) =&gt; void) { return (p1: any) =&gt; { return (p2: any) =&gt; { return (p3: any) =&gt; { return f(p1, p2, p3) } } } } export default { curry0, curry1, curry2, curry3 }So with a function that have 3 parameters, we can use curry3 to partially apply the first 2 parameters. Then we have a function that accepts just a callback, and this is turned into Promise via toPromise const readWorkout = curry.curry3(HealthManager.readWorkout)(DateUtils.startDate))(DateUtils.endDate)) const workouts = await toPromise(readWorkout)Where to go from hereHere are some of my favorite posts to read more about curry Higher order functions Introduction to Function Currying in Swift Swift Function Currying Currying in JavaScript: I like how he uses memory and slice to gradually build more generic curry function","link":"/blog/Curry-in-Swift-and-Javascript/"},{"title":"Favorite WWDC 2018 sessions","text":"Issue #245 Original post https://medium.com/fantageek/my-favourite-wwdc-2018-sessions-363d3fc9c9d5 Favourite WWDC 2018 sessionsThis year I failed the lottery ticket to WWDC, and I also missed the keynote live stream because I was sailing on the Christian Radich outside Oslo fjord that day. Luckily all the videos are available on Apple Developer site very shortly, and we can watch them now on Chrome or the unofficial WWDC app on macOS. I recommend the WWDC macOS app as it allows to mark favourites and filter, also offers the ability to adjust play speed to 1.25 or 1.5 saves me some time watching. This year WWDC focuses a lot on privacy, stability, and speed, which are all I wish, so many thanks to Apple engineers who made that happen, and the resit to install the so called more stable iOS 12 is real. As an iOS engineers, I like to focus more about the necessary things to me, that is about the Swift programming language, new changes in Cocoa Touch, enhancements in Xcode and testing tricks. I also like to explore more about machine learning so I‚Äôm very glad that Apple is investing more into this technology with the introduction of Turi Create and Create ML. To me, APIs come and get deprecated very often and it‚Äôs good to know them, but the most important thing is to invest in your programming, debugging and testing skill which you can apply in many other platforms. Continued from last year favourites list, below are my favourite sessions with personal notes. Things are listed in no particular order. Hope you find it useful. Platforms State of the UnionIf you don‚Äôt have time, you should watch only this session. Platform State of the Union is like keynote for developers as it highlights important changes. Privacy: Apple confirms on its commitment in privacy and security, also introduces password management feature and auto fill on iOS 12. Generating strong password, integrating with 3rd password management and quickly populating OTP field from SMS message have never been easier. GateKeeper gets some improvements as well and begins to require app to be notarised. iOS 12: huge improvement in performance, Siri gets smarter with Shortcut support, group calling in FaceTime and grouped notification. Also for emoji fan, Memoji was introduced. macOS 10.14 Mojave: more with Dark Mode. They demo mostly with Xcode in dark mode, which looks so cool. This year WWDC banner give hints about iOS and macOS cross-platform apps, which is partially true with Marzipan, a way to allow iOS apps to run on the mac. Xcode 10: with improvements in code editing and source control changes bar indicator. Debugging with memory debug tool, LLDB performance enhancement and particular the new build system completely rewritten in Swift with parallel tasks are exciting news. Swift 4.2: if you follow swift repo then Swift 4.2 may not be very surprising. There are also announcements for Swift 5 plan. Machine Learning: is never hotter than this. This year we see huge investments in machine learning with Create ML, Turi Create, Natural Language frameworks, CoreML 2, new detection capabilities in Vision. ARKit 2, watchOS 5, tvOS 12, AppStore Connect and AppStore Connect APIs are some other important news you don‚Äôt want to miss. What‚Äôs new in Swift Together with this session, I recommend you to read What‚Äôs new in Swift 4.2 summary which is very succinct. Besides improvement in complication and runtime, Swift 4.2 offers some new features: iterable enum case, synthesised Equatable and Hashable, handy functions for shuffling, random generating. To me, the need to explicitly handle Implicitly unwrapped optional is also a reasonable change. What‚Äôs New in Cocoa Touch This is a brief introduction to all changes coming to iOS 12, together with tips on how to be a good iOS citizen. Learn what can affect scrolling experience and prefetching technique, memory consumption and automatic backing stores, how to get the best from UIImage and UIImageView . AutoLayout engine got a lot of performance improvement so it won‚Äôt bother you any more. To me the most satisfying is to get all the UIKit notifications and classes reorganised under nested types, which makes code reasoning very easy. Getting the Most out of Playgrounds in Xcode I‚Äôve written about Playground before and I‚Äôm very glad that Apple also invests a lot in it. The way people can interact and train model [Create ML](http://Introducing Create ML) in Playground is mesmerising. People may question how Playground works so well in session‚Äôs demos, but we can‚Äôt resist the new changes coming to Playground like Step by Step execution, markup rendering improvements and also how easy it is to consume custom frameworks. We can also now publish our own Playground through subscription. What‚Äôs New in Core ML Apple starts the machine learning trend last year with the introduction of Core ML. We might be excited and frustrated at the same time as Core ML is powerful but there‚Äôs no way we can customise it. Now the 2 parts tell us how to implement custom layer and model, techniques to reduce model size like quantisation and flexible model. This makes the foundation for improvement in Vision in object tracking and the debut of Natural Language framework. Machine learning has never been easier. What‚Äôs New in TestingI can‚Äôt miss any testing sessions as it is part of every day‚Äôs work. How can your program avoids regression bugs and ready for refactoring without any tests? This session shows improvement in coverage and the introduction of xccov tool to help us build automation on top of coverage report. Parallel distributed testing in Xcode 10 can save us some time to have coffee. Another wonderful news is that tests have multiple order execution mode to avoid bugs due to implicit dependencies. Testing Tips &amp; Tricks üåü This is my most favourite. The session starts with a pyramid of tests with unit integration and end-to-end test analogy explanation, then to some very cool tips and tricks. Testing network request: I like the separation of APIRequest and APIRequestLoader with URLSession , dependency injection with default parameter and the customisation of URLProtocol in URLSessionConfiguration Testing notification: Notification is system wide and I try to avoid it as much as possible. This shows how to inject dependency with default parameter and use of own NotificationCenter instead of NotificationCenter.default to ease testing Testing location: build abstraction with LocationProvider and LocationFetcher . How to use custom protocol and protocol for delegate to mock during test Testing timer: how to use and mock RunLoop behaviour with Timer Advanced Debugging with Xcode and LLDB LLDB has been improved to enable to debugging reliability experience, issues with AST context corruption, Swift type resolution are now things in the past. We can review how to use some common LLDB commands with handy arguments, and how to use Xcode breakpoint to its best. A Tour of UICollectionView üåü I begin to use UICollectionView more than UITableView , and it also has same code as NSCollectionView,which is more comfortable solution than the horrible NSTableView . Item size in UICollectionViewLayout : I often rely on UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout to specify item size but after watching this session, I feel like moving size related code to Layout object feels more like a good way to go Mosaic layout: This is not new, but good to watch again. You learn how to implement custom layout using cached layout attributes Data Source update: I didn‚Äôt expect Apple mentions this, but it is a good lesson on how UICollectionView handles batch update. I ‚Äòve written about this before in my A better way to update UICollectionView data in Swift with diff framework and that post gets a lot of attractions. In this session we need to remember that *ordering matters in data source update, but not in collection view update *‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è Swift Generics Generic was a core feature of Swift since the beginning, we all know that it helps us to implement generic code that can work with many types in a type safe manner. This session reminds that I ‚Äòve never learned enough, especially the reasonable design behind it. The sessions showcases Collection protocol and its protocol inheritances: MutableCollection , BidirectionalCollection , RandomAccessCollection and how they can be combined to provide generic functionalities for conformers. The associatedtype requirement in each protocol, especially Index and Element, is very minimal and has enough constraints for the protocol to implement lots of necessary functionalities in its protocol extension, which is eye opening for me. I very like to read open source, so looking at the source code for such protocols helps me understand more. The part about Fisher Yates shuffle algorithm details how we can come up with necessary protocol while still make them generic Pay attention to when they mention count and map , you can learn more how each concrete type can hook into the customisation point in protocol extension Finally learn the Liskov substitution principle with protocol in class inheritance. You should also Using Collections Effectively for how to utilise handy functions in Collection. Data You Can Trust Although Codable has a lot to offers in term of data integrity, this is good to know about to make sure the data you receive is actually the right data in correct format and structure. CommonCrypto is also part of new iOS SDK so you don‚Äôt need my Arcane library to handle encryption and hashing in your apps. Embracing Algorithms This is the most pleasant to watch as it is like a conversation between the speaker and the imaginary manager Crusty. Here I learn how to be aware of algorithm complexity and also how to utilise built in Foundation functions which are already optimised for performance. After this session I can‚Äôt help myself but going to Swift repo to read the Algorithms.swift file immediately. Image and Graphics Best Practices Learn how image encoding and decoding works through data and image buffer and how that affects memory and performance. There are techniques like downsampling that can tackle this problem. This also recommends against using backing store, and instead, use UIImageView A Guide to Turi Create I‚Äôve written about Turi Create before, but it is just scratching the surface of the many tasks offered by Turi. This year Apple releases Turi Create 5 with style transfer task, Vision Feature Print, GPU acceleration and recommender model improvements. I can‚Äôt wait to explore. And if you take a look at MLDataTable in Create ML framework, it looks like this has Turi ‚Äòs SFrame under the hood. That‚Äôs it. Thanks for reading. What are your favourite sessions this year? Please share in the comment section below","link":"/blog/Favorite-WWDC-2018-sessions/"},{"title":"Favorite WWDC 2019 sessions","text":"Issue #305 This year I‚Äôm lucky enough to get the ticket to WWDC and I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied. 5 conference days full of awesomeness, talks, labs and networking, all make WWDC special and memorial conference for every attendee. As predicted by many, Marzipan (now officially called Project Catalyst) a technology that could allow iOS apps to be ported to macOS, would be the main topic for this year. But WWDC went more spectacular than that, with dark mode on iOS, independent watchOS apps, and SwiftUI being the star of the show. With over 150 sessions and extra videos, it can be a bit overwhelming to catch up, so I sum up 10 essential sessions to get started. It‚Äôs good to catch up with the latest technology, but be aware that frameworks and APIs come and get deprecated very often. It‚Äôs better to understand why they are introduced, how to learn the skills and mindset so we can apply them in our apps to delight user experience. Firstly, a little tip to get the most of WWDC videos. Although you can watch on Apple developer website, there‚Äôs WWDC for macOS app that allows much more comfortable watching experience. There we can tweak playing speed, picture in picture view mode, favorite and download videos for offline watching. Secondly, for those of you who want to search some texts in the talks, there is ASCIIwwdc that provides full transcripts of all the talks. 1. Platform State of the UnionIf you only have time for 1 video, this is it. Right after the Keynote, Platform State of the Union is like keynote for developers as it highlights important development changes. macOS 10.15, iOS 13, watchOS 6 and tvOS 13: As usual we get version bumps on all major platforms, which brings lots of new features and enhancement. macOS 10.15 is caleld Catalina and there‚Äôs a whole new platform for iPad called iPadOS. Security and Privacy: Adding to security enhancement from last year, this year shows how Apple really commits into this. There are one-time location permission, signing with Apple, security protocol for HomeKit, new crypto framework which marks MD5 as insecure. Also, apps that target kids can‚Äôt display ad or include analytics. tvOS 13 gets multiple user support watchOS 6 makes way for independent watch apps, which does not require accompanying iOS apps. There‚Äôs also dedicated watch appstore. iOS 13 now can live in the dark, but dropping support for iPhone 5S, 6 and below. Also, there is ability to toggle language setting per app only. iPadOS is a spinoff version of iOS for now, they look the same but they are expected to take different paths. It includes mouse support and requires iPad Air 2 and newer devices. macOS 10.15 introduces a replacement of bash with zsh. It also supports SideCar which allows iPad as an external display. Last but not least, there is Project Catalyst that enables iPad apps to run on the mac. Xcode 11 includes Swift 5.1 that can target latest SDKs. It brings a new look and feel with tons of features like minimap, Xcode preview, official support for Swift Package Manager, source control enhancement and test plan. 2. What‚Äôs New in SwiftAlthough Swift is developed in the open, it‚Äôs easy to lose track of in tons of proposals and changes. Swift 5.1 brings lots of cool features that power SwiftUI and Combine, so it‚Äôs a prerequisite. Module stability: This looks unimportant but this may be the most key feature of Swift 5.1. Unlike ABI stability we get in Swift 5, module stability helps resolves differences at compile time. In other words, this ensures a Swift 5 library will work with the future Swift compilers. A single expression can be declared without return keyword Function builder, with marker @_functionBuilder which works pretty much like function with receiver in Kotlin, allows for some very neat DSL syntax. Property wrapper, a counterpart of Kotlin delegated property, allows property accessors to be used in a convenient way. Shipped with Swift 5.1, we can use that with @propertyWrapper annotation. Opaque return type with some keyword remedies limitation of Swift protocol with Self or associcated types requirements. Among other things, there are other cool features like universal Self, static subscripts, collection diffing and matching against optional. 3. Introducing SwiftUI: Building Your First AppWelcome to the spotlight of WWDC 2019, SwiftUI. It may be the most exciting announcement since Swift was introduced in 2014. SwiftUI is not just a new framework, it‚Äôs a complete paradigm shift from imperative programming with UIKit/AppKit to a declarative world. I was amazed by how quickly React and Flutter allows fast prototyping and developing, so I‚Äôm very happy Apple finally makes this available natively on all platforms. The cool thing about SwiftUI is that it is expressive and has consistent syntax across platforms. So it is a learn once, write anywhere concept. Together with hot reloading of Xcode Preview, this ends the long debate among iOS community about whether to write UI in code or Storyboard, as the source of truth is now the concise code, but users are free to change any UI details via interactive Preview. Not only SwiftUI handles consistent UI according to Apple design guideline, it also provides many features for free like accessibility, dark mode and other bookkeeping. SwiftUI supports latest platform versions and no backward compatibility, so some of us have to wait 1 or 2 more years until iOS 13 is widely adopted. To learn more about SwiftUI, there are other advanced sesions like SwiftUI Essentials Building Custom Views with SwiftUI Data Flow Through SwiftUI SwiftUI On All Devices Integrating SwiftUI 4. Implementing Dark Mode on iOSAs much as I was excited about Dark theme in Android Q, Dark Mode in iOS is something that eases my eyes. Some apps also support Dark theme by their owns, but with iOS 13, supporting Dark mode to our apps is not a daunting task. There are more vibrancy materials, system colors that adapts automatically to dark and light modes. We can also select images for each mode in Asset Catalog easily. 5. Introducing Combine and Advances in FoundationCombine is a unified declarative framework for processing values over time. As a huge fan of Rx, Combine looks like home. It was thrilled to see this finnaly get supported official by Apple. This simplifying asyncrhonous programming a lot, also streamline other communication patterns like KVO and notification center. Combine is the force the powers reactive nature in SwiftUI with Binding and BindableObject. There‚Äôs also lots of improvements to Foundation like collection diffing, new list and relative formatters, and notably Combine syntax for URLSession, which makes networking a breeze. To learn more about Combine, there‚Äôs Combine in Practice where we can learn more about error handling, schedule work and many operators on streams. 6. Modernizing Your UI for iOS 13Take a look at this talk to learn about new features in iOS 13 that we should be aware in our apps. Newly in iOS 13, we can take advantage of card style modal presentation that is very cumbersome to replicate ourselves. There‚Äôs also new UISearchBarTextField with advanced customizations for token and inputs. Lastly, the new UIMenu makes showing context menu trivial and make way for iPad apps to behave like native on the mac. 7. Modern Swift API DesignIf you‚Äôre developing iOS apps, chances are that you have already stumbled upon API Design Guidelines which contains valuable guides to structuring our Swift code. This highlights my most favorite programming advice ‚ÄúClarity at the point of use‚Äù, because things we declare are written only once, but read many many times, so we should make those concise and clear. There‚Äôs also mention of preferring generic over protocol which reminds me of protocol witness technique. This talk details how Apple engineers themselves design Swift code in their RealityKit and SwiftUI frameworks. 8. Optimizing App LaunchThe launch time of your app can be decisive in user experience, it needs to be fast and do just the necessary things. With enhancements via shared and cached frameworks, apps now load faster on iOS 13. But there‚Äôs more thing we can do to improve this, thanks to the new App Launch profiler in Xcode 11, together with app launch time measurement in XCTests. The 3 words we can take away from this talk is minimize, prioritize, and optimize work at this critical launch time. 9. Introducing iPad Apps for MacStarting with iOS 13 with Project Catalyst, there‚Äôs a new target environment check called UIKitForMac, which allows iPad apps to target the mac while using the same code base. Most of the UI after porting have the correct look and feel like a native macOS app with many features provided for free like window management. There are, kind of obviously, some frameworks that are designed specifically for phone and tablet experience, can‚Äôt be supported in macOS. There are other sesions like Taking iPad Apps for Mac to the Next Level where we can learn more about this. 10. Creating Independent Watch Apps watchOS finally gets its own Appstore and the ability to run independent watchOS apps without a companying iOS app. With the introduction of URLSession and streaming APIs for the watch, together with enhancements in push notifications, Apple sign in, debugging, this can‚Äôt be a better time to start developing for the watch. It is stunning to see how Apple comes up with so many cool announcements this year while keeping innovation and quality high. There are more sessions to explore, head over to WWDC 2019 developer website to learn more.","link":"/blog/Favorite-WWDC-2019-sessions/"},{"title":"How to build a networking in Swift","text":"Issue #195 Miami https://github.com/onmyway133/Miami Future based builders Should not wrap system API URLSession offer tons of thing that it‚Äôs hard to use with wrappers like Alamofire ConcernsParameter encoding is confusing-https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md#parameter-encoding Query and body builder Understanding HTML Form Encoding: URL Encoded and Multipart Forms https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14551194/how-are-parameters-sent-in-an-http-post-request https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1617058/ok-to-skip-slash-before-query-string https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3508338/what-is-the-boundary-in-multipart-form-data How to construct URL with URLComponents and appendPathComponent in Swift HTTP Case sensitivity in HTTP Lazy execution Promise https://github.com/onmyway133/Then Signal and Future https://github.com/onmyway133/archives/tree/master/Signal Catch error How to catch error in ApolloClient Implementation How to cancel DispatchWorkItem and NSOperation Understanding DispatchQueues Use Promise to handle chain and errorhttps://github.com/onmyway133/Miami/blob/master/Sources/Shared/Future/Future.swift 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170171172173174175176177178179180181182183184185186187188189190191192193194195196197198199200201202import Foundationpublic class Token { private let lock = NSRecursiveLock() private var _isCancelled = false private var callbacks: [() -&gt;

If your app previously registered for remote notifications, calling the registerForRemoteNotifications method again does not incur any additional overhead, and iOS returns the existing device token to your app delegate immediately. In addition, iOS calls your delegate method any time the device token changes, not just in response to your app registering or re-registeringThe user can change the notification settings for your app at any time using the Settings app. Because settings can change, always call the registerUserNotificationSettings: at launch time and use the application:didRegisterUserNotificationSettings: method to get the response. If the user disallows specific notification types, avoid using those types when configuring local and remote notifications for your app. didReceiveRemoteNotification About application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: Implement the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: method instead of this one whenever possible. If your delegate implements both methods, the app object calls the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: method.If the app is not running when a remote notification arrives, the method launches the app and provides the appropriate information in the launch options dictionary. The app does not call this method to handle that remote notification. Instead, your implementation of the application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions: or application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method needs to get the remote notification payload data and respond appropriately. About application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: This is for silent push notification with content-available Unlike the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: method, which is called only when your app is running in the foreground, the system calls this method when your app is running in the foreground or backgroundIn addition, if you enabled the remote notifications background mode, the system launches your app (or wakes it from the suspended state) and puts it in the background state when a push notification arrives. However, the system does not automatically launch your app if the user has force-quit it. In that situation, the user must relaunch your app or restart the device before the system attempts to launch your app automatically again.If the user opens your app from the system-displayed alert, the system may call this method again when your app is about to enter the foreground so that you can update your user interface and display information pertaining to the notification. How to handleUsually, the use of push notification is to display a specific article, a specific DetailViewControllerin your app. So the good practices are When the app is in foreground: Gently display some kind of alert view and ask the user whether he would like to go to that specific page or not When user is brought from background to foreground, or from terminated to foreground: Just navigate to that specific page. For example, if you use UINavigationController, you can set that specific page the top most ViewController, if you use UITabBarController, you can set that specific page the selected tab, something like that 1234567891011- func handlePushNotification(userInfo: NSDictionary) { // Check applicationState if (applicationState == UIApplicationStateActive) { // Application is running in foreground showAlertForPushNotification(userInfo) } else if (applicationState == UIApplicationStateBackground || applicationState == UIApplicationStateInactive) { // Application is brought from background or launched after terminated handlePushNotification(userInfo) }} Here we create another method handlePushNotification to handle push notification. When you receive push notification, 3 cases can occur Case 1: ForegroundLoud push No system alert application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called Silent push No system alert application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called Case 2: BackgroundLoud push System alert No method called Tap notification and application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called Tap on App Icon and nothing is called Silent push No system alert application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called. If app is suspended, its state changed to UIApplicationStateBackground Tap notification and application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called Tap on App Icon and nothing is called Case 3: TerminatedLoud push System alert No method called Tap notification and application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: with launchOptions, application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called Tap on App Icon and application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: is called with launchOptions set to nil Silent push No system alert application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called. If app was not killed by user, it is woke up and state changed to UIApplicationStateInactive. Tap notification and application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: with launchOptions, application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called Tap on App Icon and application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: is called with launchOptions set to nil System alertSystem alert only show if the payload contains alert 123456789101112{ \"aps\" : { \"alert\" : { \"title\" : \"Game Request\", \"body\" : \"Bob wants to play poker\", \"action-loc-key\" : \"PLAY\" }, \"badge\" : 5 }, \"param1\" : \"bar\", \"param2\" : [ \"bang\", \"whiz\" ]} Silent push payloadFor now I see that silent push must contain sound for application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: to be called when app is in background 123456789{ ‚Äúaps‚Äù: { ‚Äúcontent-available‚Äù: 1, ‚Äúalert‚Äù: ‚Äúhello‚Äù // include this if we want to show alert ‚Äúsound‚Äù: ‚Äú‚Äù // this does the trick }, ‚Äúparam1‚Äù: 1, ‚Äúparam2‚Äù: ‚Äútext‚Äù} Read Pushing Background Updates to Your App If your app‚Äôs server-based content changes infrequently or at irregular intervals, you can use background notifications to notify your app when new content becomes available. A background notification is a remote notification that doesn‚Äôt display an alert, play a sound, or badge your app‚Äôs icon. It wakes your app in the background and gives it time to initiate downloads from your server and update its content. The system treats background notifications as low-priority: you can use them to refresh your app‚Äôs content, but the system doesn‚Äôt guarantee their delivery. In addition, the system may throttle the delivery of background notifications if the total number becomes excessive. The number of background notifications allowed by the system depends on current conditions, but don‚Äôt try to send more than two or three per hour. How to test Push notificationI built a macOS app called PushNotification for you to test push notification. It works with certificate and the new key authentication with APNS.

At least that‚Äôs according to my initial assumption. This article aims to detail what I have learned about keyboard handling and how to avoid extra tap when dealing with TextInput There will also be lots of code spelunking, thanks to the all the libraries being open source. The version of React Native I‚Äôm using at the time of writing is 0.57.5 The built in TextInput componentReact Native comes with a bunch of basic components, one of them is the TextInput for inputting text into the app via a keyboard. import React, { Component } from &apos;react&apos;; import { AppRegistry, TextInput } from &apos;react-native&apos;; export default class UselessTextInput extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { text: &apos;Useless Placeholder&apos; }; } render() { return ( &lt;TextInput style={{height: 40, borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1}} onChangeText={(text) =&gt; this.setState({text})} value={this.state.text} /&gt; ); } }That‚Äôs it, whenever we click on the text input, keyboard appears allowing us to enter values. To dismiss the keyboard by pressing anywhere on the screen, the easy solution is to TouchableWithoutFeedback together with Keyboard . This is similar to having UITapGestureRecognizer in iOS UIView and calling view.endEditing import { Keyboard } from &apos;react-native&apos; Keyboard.dismiss()TextInput inside ScrollViewNormally we should have some text inputs inside a scrolling component, in React Native that is mostly ScrollView to be able to handle long list of content and avoid keyboard. If TextInput is inside ScrollView then the way keyboard gets dismissed behaves a bit differently, and depends on keyboardShouldPersistTaps Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap. ‚Äònever‚Äô (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won‚Äôt receive the tap. ‚Äòalways‚Äô, the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps. ‚Äòhandled‚Äô, the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor). The never mode should be the desired behaviour in most cases, clicking anywhere outside the focused text input should dismiss the keyboard. In my app, there are some text inputs and an action button. The scenario is that users enter some infos and then press that button to register data. With the never mode, we have to press button twice, one for dismissing the keyboard, and two for the onPress of the Button . So the solution is to use always mode. This way the Button always gets the press event first. &lt;ScrollView keyboardShouldPersistTaps=&apos;always&apos; /&gt;ScrollView cares about keyboardThe native RCTScrollView class that power react native ScrollView has code to handle dismiss mode RCT_SET_AND_PRESERVE_OFFSET(setKeyboardDismissMode, keyboardDismissMode, UIScrollViewKeyboardDismissMode)The option that it chooses is UIScrollViewKeyboardDismissMode for keyboardDismissMode property The manner in which the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins in the scroll view. As you can see, the possible modes are onDrag and interactive . And react native exposes customization point for this via keyboardShouldPersistTaps case none The keyboard does not get dismissed with a drag. case onDrag The keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins. case interactive The keyboard follows the dragging touch offscreen, and can be pulled upward again to cancel the dismiss. ScrollView inside a ModalBut that does not work when ScrollView is inside Modal . By Modal I meant the Modal component in React Native. The only library that I use is react-navigation , and it supports Opening a full-screen modal too, but they way we declare modal in react-navigation looks like stack and it is confusing, so I would rather not use it. I use Modal in react-native and that works pretty well. So if we have TextInput inside ScrollView inside Modal then keyboardShouldPersistTaps does not work. Modal seems to be aware of parent ScrollView so we have to declare keyboardShouldPersistTaps=‚Äôalways‚Äô on every parent ScrollView . In React Native FlatList and SectionList uses ScrollView under the hood, so we need to be aware of all those ScrollView components. Spelunking react-navigationSince my app relies heavily on react-navigation , it‚Äôs good to have a deep understanding about its components so we make sure where the problem lies. I‚Äôve written a bit about react-navigation structure below.Using react-navigation 3.0 in React Native appsreact-navigation is probably the only dependency I use in React Native apps. I‚Äôm happy with it so far, then version 3.0‚Ä¶codeburst.io Like every traditional mobile apps, my app consists of many stack navigators inside tab navigator. In iOS that means many UINavigationViewController inside UITabbarController . In react-navigation I use createMaterialTopTabNavigator inside createBottomTabNavigator import { createMaterialTopTabNavigator } from &apos;react-navigation&apos; import { createBottomTabNavigator, BottomTabBar } from &apos;react-navigation-tabs&apos;The screen I have keyboard issue is a Modal presented from the 2nd screen in one of the stack navigators, so let‚Äôs examine every possible ScrollView up the hierarchy. This process involves lots of code reading and this‚Äôs how I love open source. First let‚Äôs start with createBottomTabNavigator which uses createTabNavigator together with its own TabNavigationView class TabNavigationView extends React.PureComponent&lt;Props, State&gt; export default createTabNavigator(TabNavigationView);Tab navigator has tab bar view below ScreenContainer , which is used to contain view. ScreenContainer is from react-native-screens ‚ÄúThis project aims to expose native navigation container components to React Native‚Äù. Below is how tab navigator works. render() { const { navigation, renderScene, lazy } = this.props; const { routes } = navigation.state; const { loaded } = this.state return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; &lt;ScreenContainer style={styles.pages}&gt; {routes.map((route, index) =&gt; { if (lazy &amp;&amp; !loaded.includes(index)) { // Don&apos;t render a screen if we&apos;ve never navigated to it return null; const isFocused = navigation.state.index === index return ( &lt;ResourceSavingScene key={route.key} style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill} isVisible={isFocused} &gt; {renderScene({ route })} &lt;/ResourceSavingScene&gt; ); })} &lt;/ScreenContainer&gt; {this._renderTabBar()} &lt;/View&gt; ); }Tab bar is rendered using BottomTabBar in _renderTabBar function. Looking at the code, the whole tab navigator has nothing to do with ScrollView . So there is only createMaterialTopTabNavigator left on the suspecting list. I use it in the app with swipeEnabled: true . And by looking at the imports, top tab navigator has import MaterialTopTabBar, { type TabBarOptions,} from &apos;../views/MaterialTopTabBar&apos;;MaterialTopTabBar has import from react-native-tab-view import { TabBar } from &apos;react-native-tab-view&apos;;which has ScrollView &lt;View style={styles.scroll}&gt; &lt;Animated.ScrollView horizontal keyboardShouldPersistTaps=&quot;handled&quot;The property keyboardShouldPersistTaps was initial set to always , then set back to handled to avoid the bug that we can‚Äôt press any button in tab bar while keyboard is open https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view/issues/375 But this TabBar has nothing with our problem, because it‚Äôs just for containing tab bar buttons. Swiping in createMaterialTopTabNavigatorTaking another look at createMaterialTopTabNavigator we see more imports from react-native-tab-view import { TabView, PagerPan } from &apos;react-native-tab-view&apos;;TabView has swipeEnabled passed in return ( &lt;TabView {...rest} navigationState={navigation.state} animationEnabled={animationEnabled} swipeEnabled={swipeEnabled} onAnimationEnd={this._handleAnimationEnd} onIndexChange={this._handleIndexChange} onSwipeStart={this._handleSwipeStart} renderPager={renderPager} renderTabBar={this._renderTabBar} renderScene={ /* $FlowFixMe */ this._renderScene } /&gt; );and it renders PagerDefault, which in turn uses PagerScroll for iOS import { Platform } from &apos;react-native&apos;; let Pager; switch (Platform.OS) { case &apos;android&apos;: Pager = require(&apos;./PagerAndroid&apos;).default; break; case &apos;ios&apos;: Pager = require(&apos;./PagerScroll&apos;).default; break; default: Pager = require(&apos;./PagerPan&apos;).default; break; } export default Pager;So PagerScroll uses ScrollView to handle scrolling to match material style that user can scroll between pages, and it has keyboardShouldPersistTaps=‚Äùalways‚Äù which should be correct. return ( &lt;ScrollView horizontal pagingEnabled directionalLockEnabled keyboardDismissMode=&quot;on-drag&quot; keyboardShouldPersistTaps=&quot;always&quot;So nothing looks suspicious in react-navigation , which urges me to look at code from my project. Debugging FlatList, SectionList and ScrollViewLike I stated in the beginning of this article, the root problem is that we need to declare keyboardShouldPersistTaps for all parent ScrollView in the hierarchy. That means to look out for any FlatList, SectionList and ScrollView Luckily, there is react-devtools that shows tree of all rendered components in react app, and that is also guided in Debugging section of react native. You can use the standalone version of React Developer Tools to debug the React component hierarchy. To use it, install the react-devtools package globally: npm install -g react-devtoolsSo after searching I found out that there is a SectionList up the hierarchy that should have keyboardShouldPersistTaps=‚Äôalways‚Äô while it didn‚Äôt. Taking a thorough look at the code, I found out that the Modal is trigged from a SectionList item. We already know that triggering Modal in react native means that to embed that Modal inside the view hierarchy and control its visibility via a state. So in terms of view and component, that Modal is inside a SectionList . And for your interest, if you dive deep into react native code, SectionList in my case is just VirtualizedSectionList , which is VirtualizedList, which uses ScrollView So after I declare keyboardShouldPersistTaps=‚Äôalways‚Äô in that SectionList , the problem is solved. User can now just enters some values in the text inputs, then press once on the submit button to submit data. The button now captures touch events first instead of scrollview. Where to go from hereThe solution for this is fortunately simple as it involves fixing our code without having to alter react-navigation code. But it‚Äôs good to look at the library code to know what it does, and to trace where the problem originates. Thanks for following such long exploring and hope you learn something.","link":"/blog/How-to-dismiss-keyboard-with-react-navigation-in-React-Native-apps/"},{"title":"How to fix SSLPeerUnverifiedException in Android","text":"Issue #184 Get error javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: No peer certificate in Android API 16 to API 19 Getting startedRead about HTTPS and SSL https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-sslCheck backend TLS https://www.ssllabs.com/index.htmlTLS by default in Android P https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/protecting-users-with-tls-by-default-in.html TLS versionRead https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLSocket.html This class extends Sockets and provides secure socket using protocols such as the ‚ÄúSecure Sockets Layer‚Äù (SSL) or IETF ‚ÄúTransport Layer Security‚Äù (TLS) protocols.

But it is by default disabled but starting with API level 20+ (Android 4.4 for watch, Kitkat Watch and Android 5.0 for phone, Lollipop) they are enabled. But it is very hard to find any documentation about how to enable it for phones running 4.1 for example. The first thing you need to do is to make sure that your minimum required API level is 16 to have the following code working in your project. To enable TLS 1.1 and 1.2 you need to create a custom SSLSocketFactory that is going to proxy all calls to a default SSLSocketFactory implementation. In addition to that do we have to override all createSocket methods and callsetEnabledProtocols on the returned SSLSocket to enable TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2.

Hope you will find it useful, too. This post starts with techniques from Objective age, but many of the concepts still hold true The naive waySome API you already know in UIKit can be used for checking internet connection. Most of them are synchronous code, so you ‚Äòd better call them in a background thread 12345678- (BOOL)connectedToInternet{ NSString *string = [NSString stringWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://www.google.com\"] encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:nil]; return string ?

YES : NO;} Using SystemConfiguration frameworkAfter importing the SystemConfiguration framework, you can use either SCNetworkReachabilityGetFlags to synchronously get the reachability status, or provide a callback to SCNetworkReachabilitySetCallback to be notified about reachability status change. Note that SCNetworkReachabilityGetFlags is synchronous. The System Configuration framework reachability API () operates synchronously by default. Thus, seemingly innocuous routines like SCNetworkReachabilityGetFlags can get you killed by the watchdog. If you‚Äôre using the reachability API, you should use it asynchronously. This involves using the SCNetworkReachabilityScheduleWithRunLoop routine to schedule your reachability queries on the run loop 12345678910111213141516- (BOOL) isConnectionAvailable{ SCNetworkReachabilityFlags flags; BOOL receivedFlags; SCNetworkReachabilityRef reachability = SCNetworkReachabilityCreateWithName(CFAllocatorGetDefault(), [@\"dipinkrishna.com\" UTF8String]); receivedFlags = SCNetworkReachabilityGetFlags(reachability, &amp;flags); CFRelease(reachability); if (!receivedFlags || (flags == 0) ) { return FALSE; } else { return TRUE; }} Note that SCNetworkReachabilitySetCallback notifies only when reachability status changes Assigns a client to the specified target, which receives callbacks when the reachability of the target changes Using some librariesLibraries make our life easier, but to live well with them, you must surely understand them. There are many reachability libraries on Github, but here I want to mention the most popular: Reachability from tonymillion and AFNetworkReachabilityManager (a submodule of AFNetworking) from mattt. Both use SystemConfiguration under the hood. ReachabilitySome people use Reachability like this 123456789101112131415161718192021222324- (void)testInternetConnection{ internetReachableFoo = [Reachability reachabilityWithHostname:@\"www.google.com\"]; // Internet is reachable internetReachableFoo.reachableBlock = ^(Reachability*reach) { // Update the UI on the main thread dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ NSLog(@\"Yayyy, we have the interwebs!\"); }); }; // Internet is not reachable internetReachableFoo.unreachableBlock = ^(Reachability*reach) { // Update the UI on the main thread dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ NSLog(@\"Someone broke the internet :(\"); }); }; [internetReachableFoo startNotifier];} Looking into the method ‚ÄústartNotifier‚Äù, you will see that it only uses SCNetworkReachabilitySetCallback and it means this callback will only be called if reachability status changes. If you want to know the reachability status directly, for example, the reachability status at app launch, you must use the method ‚ÄúisReachable‚Äù. This method under the hood uses SCNetworkReachabilityGetFlags which is synchronous, and it locks the calling thread. Reachability has reachabilityForLocalWiFi, which is interesting :) 1234567891011+(Reachability*)reachabilityForLocalWiFi{ struct sockaddr_in localWifiAddress; bzero(&amp;localWifiAddress, sizeof(localWifiAddress)); localWifiAddress.sin_len = sizeof(localWifiAddress); localWifiAddress.sin_family = AF_INET; // IN_LINKLOCALNETNUM is defined in &lt;netinet/in.h&gt; as 169.254.0.0 localWifiAddress.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(IN_LINKLOCALNETNUM); return [self reachabilityWithAddress:&amp;localWifiAddress];} AFNetworkReachabilityManagerWith AFNetworkReachabilityManager, all you have to do is 1234567- (void)trackInternetConnection{ [[AFNetworkReachabilityManager sharedManager] startMonitoring]; [[AFNetworkReachabilityManager sharedManager] setReachabilityStatusChangeBlock:^(AFNetworkReachabilityStatus status) { // Handle the status }];} What is nice about AFNetworkReachabilityManager is that in the ‚ÄústartMonitoring‚Äù method, it both uses SCNetworkReachabilitySetCallback and calls AFNetworkReachabilityStatusForFlags to get the initial reachability status in a background thread, and calls the AFNetworkReachabilityStatusBlock. So in the user ‚Äòs point of view, all we care about is the AFNetworkReachabilityStatusBlock handler. AFNetworking has all the features that Reachability has, and its code is well structured. Another cool thing about it is that it is already in your AFNetworking pod.

The other day, I saw someone asking on how to migrate if the model changes https://github.com/hyperoslo/Cache/issues/153, and he likes the way Realm does https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#migrations 123456789101112131415Realm.Configuration.defaultConfiguration = Realm.Configuration( schemaVersion: 1, migrationBlock: { migration, oldSchemaVersion in if (oldSchemaVersion &lt; 1) { // The enumerateObjects(ofType:_:) method iterates // over every Person object stored in the Realm file migration.enumerateObjects(ofType: Person.className()) { oldObject, newObject in // combine name fields into a single field let firstName = oldObject![\"firstName\"] as!

It‚Äôs easy to get unpublished software notarized with the Export process or xcodebuild. Custom build workflows are supported by the xcrun altool command line tool for uploading, and you can use xcrun stapler to attach the ticket to the package. Published Software. To submit software you‚Äôve already published, upload it using the xcrun altool command line tool. Several file types are supported, including .zip, .pkg, and .dmg, so you can upload the same package you already distribute to users. Notarizing Your App Before Distributionhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution When you click Next, Xcode uploads your archive to the notary service. When the upload is complete, the notary service begins the scanning process, which usually takes less than an hour. While the notary service scans your software, you can continue to prepare your archive for distribution. For example, you can export the archive and perform any final testing that you require prior to making your software available to customers. When the notarization process finishes, Xcode downloads the ticket and staples it to your archive. At that point, export your archive again to receive a distributable version of your software that includes the notary ticket. Upload a macOS app to be notarizedhttps://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev88332a81e First, upload your macOS app to Apple to be notarized. If the upload fails, view the upload logs to find the problem. For example, you must enable hardened runtime (macOS) before you upload the app. Otherwise, check the notarization status and when the status is ‚ÄúReady for distribution‚Äù, export the app for distribution. Distribute outside the Mac App Store (macOS)https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev033e997ca In some cases, you may want to distribute an app outside of the Mac App Store. Because the app won‚Äôt be distributed by Apple, assure users that you are a trusted developer by signing your app with a Developer ID certificate. Users gain additional assurance if your Developer ID-signed app is also notarized by Apple. On macOS, if your app isn‚Äôt downloaded from the Mac App Store or signed with a Developer ID certificate, it won‚Äôt launch unless the user completely disables Gatekeeper.

From iOS 7, every app downloaded from the store has a receipt (for downloading/buying the app) at appStoreReceiptURL. When users purchases something via In App Purchase, the content at appStoreReceiptURL is updated with purchases information. Most of the cases, you just need to refresh the receipt (at appStoreReceiptURL) so that you know which transactions users have made. Users restore transactions to maintain access to content they‚Äôve already purchased. For example, when they upgrade to a new phone, they don‚Äôt lose all of the items they purchased on the old phone. Include some mechanism in your app to let the user restore their purchases, such as a Restore Purchases button. Restoring purchases prompts for the user‚Äôs App Store credentials, which interrupts the flow of your app: because of this, don‚Äôt automatically restore purchases, especially not every time your app is launched. In most cases, all your app needs to do is refresh its receipt and deliver the products in its receipt. The refreshed receipt contains a record of the user‚Äôs purchases in this app, on this device or any other device. However, some apps need to take an alternate approach for one of the following reasons: If you use Apple-hosted content, restoring completed transactions gives your app the transaction objects it uses to download the content.If you need to support versions of iOS earlier than iOS 7, where the app receipt isn‚Äôt available, restore completed transactions instead. Refreshing the receipt asks the App Store for the latest copy of the receipt. Refreshing a receipt does not create any new transactions. Restoring completed transactions creates a new transaction for every completed transaction the user made, essentially replaying history for your transaction queue observer.

In my app which uses map view, it will tap on some pins, which will present another screen, which is not correct. Since app.alerts does not work, my 2nd attempt is to check for app.windows.count. Unfortunately, it always shows 5 windows whether alert is showing or not. I know 1 is for main window, 1 is for status bar, the other 3 windows I have no idea. The 3rd attempt is to check that underlying elements (behind alert) can‚Äôt be touched, which is to use isHittable. This property does not work, it always returns true Check the contentThis uses the assumption that we only tests for when user hits Allow button. So only if alert is answered with Allow, then we have permission to display our content. For my map view, I check that there are some pins on the map.

Talked to a Core Animation engineer again: cornerRadius was deliberately improved in Metal so it could be used everywhere. Using a bitmap is WAY heavier in terms of memory and performance. CALayer maskLayer is still heavy. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/1410818-cornerradius Setting the radius to a value greater than 0.0 causes the layer to begin drawing rounded corners on its background. By default, the corner radius does not apply to the image in the layer‚Äôs contents property; it applies only to the background color and border of the layer. However, setting the masksToBounds property to true causes the content to be clipped to the rounded corners. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/1410896-maskstobounds When the value of this property is true, Core Animation creates an implicit clipping mask that matches the bounds of the layer and includes any corner radius effects. If a value for the mask property is also specified, the two masks are multiplied to get the final mask value.

Usethis type of corner in situations in which there is both movement through and movement underneaththe corner (very rare). This uses only .cornerRadius.- ASCornerRoundingTypePrecomposited: corners are drawn using bezier paths to clip the content in aCGContext / UIGraphicsContext. This requires .backgroundColor and .cornerRadius to be set. Use opaquebackground colors when possible for optimal efficiency, but transparent colors are supported and muchmore efficient than CALayer. The only limitation of this approach is that it cannot clip children, andthus works best for ASImageNodes or containers showing a background around their children.- ASCornerRoundingTypeClipping: overlays 4 separate opaque corners on top of the content that needscorner rounding. Requires .backgroundColor and .cornerRadius to be set. Use clip corners in situationsin which is movement through the corner, with an opaque background (no movement underneath the corner).Clipped corners are ideal for animating / resizing views, and still outperform CALayer. https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/79/how-to-find-and-fix-slow-drawing-using-instruments https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35685726/uibezierpath-doesnt-work-in-topright-corner-and-bottomright-corner/43808103 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6731545/when-does-a-view-or-layer-require-offscreen-rendering Generally, on iOS, pixel effects and Quartz / Core Graphics drawing are not hardware accelerated, and most other things are.The following things are not hardware accelerated, which means that they need to be done in software (offscreen):Anything done in a drawRect. If your view has a drawRect, even an empty one, the drawing is not done in hardware, and there is a performance penalty.Any layer with the shouldRasterize property set to YES.Any layer with a mask or drop shadow.Text (any kind, including UILabels, CATextLayers, Core Text, etc).Any drawing you do yourself (either onscreen or offscreen) using a CGContext. Make overlay view https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13979935/setting-corner-radius-on-a-cell-kills-uicollectionviews-performance http://www.lukeparham.com/blog/2018/3/6/friends-dont-let-friends-render-offscreen For example, writing your own draw method with Core Graphics means your rendering will technically be done in software (offscreen) as opposed to being hardware accelerated like it is when you use a normal CALayer. This is why manually rendering a UIImage with a CGContext is slower than just assigning the image to a UIImageView. https://github.com/seedante/OptimizationForOffscreenRender if layer‚Äôs contents is nil or this contents has a transparent background, you just need to set cornerRadius. For UILabel, UITextView and UIButton, you can just set layer‚Äôs backgroundColor and cornerRadius to get a rounded corner.

Shadow effects and any filters in the filters property are rasterized and included in the bitmap. However, the current opacity of the layer is not rasterized.

In regular rendering, the whole operation happens in special frame buffers that the display will directly read for rendering on the screen, repeating the process at a rate around 60 times per second. Of course the process have some drawbacks as well. The main one is that offscreen rendering requires a context switch (GPU has to change to a different memory area to perform the drawing) and then copying the resulting composited layer into the frame buffer. Every time any of the composited layers change, the cache needs to be redrawn again. This is why in many circumstances offscreen rendering is not a good idea, as it requires additional computation when need to be rerendered. Besides, the layer requires extra video memory which of course is limited, so use it with caution.

One DarkOriginal designed for Atom, one-dark-ui that claims to adapt to most syntax themes, used together with Fira Mono font from mozilla. There is also Dracula which is popular, but the contrast seem too high for my eyes. FiraI like FiraCode font the most, it is just beautiful and supports ligatures. Alternatively, you can browse ProgrammingFonts or other ligature fonts like Hasklig to see which font suits you. Theme and font are completely personal taste, but if you like me, please give One Dark and Fira a try, here is how to do that in Xcode, Android Studio and Visual Studio Code, which are editors that I use daily. XcodeFirstly, you need to install the latest compiled font of FiraCode I used to have my own replication of One Dark, called DarkSide, this was how I learned how to make Xcode theme. For now, I find xcode-one-dark good enough. Xcode theme is just xml file with .xccolortheme extension and is placed into ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes After installing the theme, you should be able to select it from Preferences -&gt; Fonts &amp; Colors And it looks like below. Android StudioAndroid Studio defaults to have only Default and Dracula theme. Let‚Äôs choose Darcula for now. I hope there will be One Dark support. Also, Android Studio can preferably selects Fira Code, which we should have already installed. Remember to select Enable font ligatures to stay cool It looks like this Visual Studio CodeInstalling theme in VSCode is easy with extensions. There is this One Dark Pro that we can install directly from Extensions panel in VS Code. Alternatively, you can also choose Atom One Dark Theme Then go to Preferences -&gt; Settings to specify Fira Code .

Well, when the Swift compiler goes to import a module, it looks for a file called the Compiled Module for that library. If it finds one of these files, it reads off the manifest of public APIs that you can call into, and lets you use them. Now, this Compiled Module Format is a binary format that basically contains internal compiler data structures. And since they‚Äôre just internal data structures, they‚Äôre subject to change with every version of the Swift Compiler. So what this means is that if one person tries to import a module using one version of Swift, and that module was created by another version of Swift, their compiler can‚Äôt understand it, and they won‚Äôt be able to use it. Well, in order to solve this version lock, Xcode 11 introduces a new format for Swift Modules, called Swift Module Interfaces. And just like the Compiled Module Format, they list out all the public APIs of a module, but in a textual form that behaves more like source code. And since they behave like source code, then future versions of the Swift Compiler will be able to import module interfaces created with older versions.

What happens under the hood is that the custom token is sent to the Firebase Auth service in exchange for an ID token and refresh token pair which are used to keep the client SDK authenticated As with custom tokens, ID tokens are short-lived JWTs, lasting for just one hour. In order to allow end users to stay logged in for more than one hour, the modern SDKs transparently refresh a user‚Äôs ID token on your behalf using a refresh token If your app includes a custom backend server, ID tokens can and should be used to communicate securely with it. Instead of sending requests with a user‚Äôs raw uid which can be easily spoofed by a malicious client, send the user‚Äôs ID token which can be verified via a Firebase Admin SDK https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens#retrieve_id_tokens_on_clients When a user or device successfully signs in, Firebase creates a corresponding ID token that uniquely identifies them and grants them access to several resources, such as Firebase Realtime Database and Cloud Storage. You can re-use that ID token to identify the user or device on your custom backend server.

That method has five seconds to perform any tasks and return. Shortly after that method returns, the system puts your app into the suspended state. For most apps, five seconds is enough to perform any crucial tasks, but if you need more time, you can ask UIKit to extend your app‚Äôs runtime. You extend your app‚Äôs runtime by calling the beginBackgroundTask(withName:expirationHandler:) method. Calling this method gives you extra time to perform important tasks.

The system will launch your app in the background and execute the tasks. https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/modern-background-tasks-ios13/ The main API for using this framework is the BGTaskScheduler . This API constantly monitors the system state such as battery level, background usage, and more, so it chooses the optimal time to run your tasks.

Initially, it displays an abbreviated banner with the title, subtitle, and two to four lines of body text from the notification.

All of these configuration changes cause the Activity to be torn down and recreated The ViewModel class is designed to hold and manage UI-related data in a life-cycle conscious way. This allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations. The ViewModel exists from when the you first request a ViewModel (usually in the onCreate the Activity) until the Activity is finished and destroyed. onCreate may be called several times during the life of an Activity, such as when the app is rotated, but the ViewModel survives throughout. Storing an Application context in a ViewModel is okay because an Application context is tied to the Application lifecycle. This is different from an Activity context, which is tied to the Activity lifecycle. In fact, if you need an Application context, you should extend AndroidViewModel which is simply a ViewModel that includes an Application reference. The first time the ViewModelProviders.of method is called by MainActivity, it creates a new ViewModel instance. When this method is called again, which happens whenever onCreate is called, it will return the pre-existing ViewModel associated with the specific Court-Counter MainActivity 1ViewModelProviders.of(&lt;THIS ARGUMENT&gt;).get(ScoreViewModel.class); This allows you to have an app that opens a lot of different instances of the same Activity or Fragment, but with different ViewModel information Dive deep into Android‚Äôs ViewModel ‚Äî Android Architecture Componentshttps://android.jlelse.eu/dive-deep-into-androids-viewmodel-android-architecture-components-e0a7ded26f70 1234567891011121314151617181920212223/** * Utilities methods for {@link ViewModelStore} class. */public class ViewModelProviders {/** * Creates a {@link ViewModelProvider}, which retains ViewModels while a scope of given Activity * is alive.

The HolderFragment has an inner static class named HolderFragmentManager. The HolderFragmentManager creates and manages HolderFragment instances.After creating the instances it associates them with an Activity or Fragment. The whole process is done using the methods holderFragmentFor(Activity) and holderFragmentFor(Fragment). How does HolderFragment retains the state ? By setting retain instance to true and not providing a view, the HolderFragment becomes essentially a headless Fragment that is retained for as long as the Activity is not destroyed. 123public HolderFragment() { setRetainInstance(true);} void setRetainInstance (boolean retain) Control whether a fragment instance is retained across Activity re-creation (such as from a configuration change). This can only be used with fragments not in the back stack. If set, the fragment lifecycle will be slightly different when an activity is recreated: Retrieving ViewModel instance1get(MyViewModel.class) It tries to retrieve a MyViewModel instance from the store. If none is there, it uses the factory to create it and then stores it into HashMap&lt;String, ViewModel&gt;. In order to retrieve the already created ViewModel, it generates a key from the class qualified name.","link":"/blog/How-to-use-ViewModel-and-ViewModelsProviders-in-Android/"},{"title":"How to use addSubview in iOS","text":"Issue #344 addSubview can trigger viewDidLayoutSubviews, so be careful to just do layout stuff in viewDidLayoutSubviews This method establishes a strong reference to view and sets its next responder to the receiver, which is its new superview. Views can have only one superview. If view already has a superview and that view is not the receiver, this method removes the previous superview before making the receiver its new superview. When the bounds change for a view controller‚Äô¬Ä¬ôs view, the view adjusts the positions of its subviews and then the system calls this method. However, this method being called does not indicate that the individual layouts of the view‚Äô¬Ä¬ôs subviews have been adjusted. Each subview is responsible for adjusting its own layout. Your view controller can override this method to make changes after the view lays out its subviews.

Take a look at BarcodeScanner and the PR https://github.com/hyperoslo/BarcodeScanner/pull/82 When it is presented, we need a header view so that we can show a title and a close button. We can create a custom HeaderView that inherits from UIView or either embed it in a UINavigationController before presenting. If we go with the controller being embedded in UINavigationController approach, it will collide with the other UINavigationController when it is pushed. If we go with custom HeaderView, then we need to layout the view so that it looks good on both portrait and landscape, and on iPhone X that as safeAreaLayoutGuide. Using standalone UINavigationBarSince UINavigationController uses UINavigationBar under the hood, which uses UINavigationItem info to present the content. We can imitate this behavior by using a standalone UINavigationBar. See Adding Content to a Standalone Navigation Bar In the vast majority of scenarios you will use a navigation bar as part of a navigation controller. However, there are situations for which you might want to use the navigation bar UI and implement your own approach to content navigation. In these situations, you can use a standalone navigation bar. A navigation bar manages a stack of UINavigationItem objects The beauty is that our standalone UINavigationBar and that of UINavigationController are the same, use the same UINavigationItem and no manual layout are needed Declare UINavigationItemWe can just set properties like we did with a normal navigationItem 123let standaloneItem = UINavigationItem()standaloneItem.leftBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(customView: closeButton)standaloneItem.titleView = UILabel() Adding UINavigationBarCustomise your bar, then declare layout constraints.

I have been for a long time curating a list‚Ä¶ to keep track of all cool videos, but it get out of hand very quickly. That‚Äôs why I make LearnTalks.com as a convenient place to search and explore new tech talks. The features include Easy search for talk, author and event See upcoming events Explore tags of topics and technologies Mobile friendly Firstly, thanks to all the people who helped me alpha test the website and provided valuable feedback. I addressed and fixed many issues.And thanks a lot to many conference organisers who gave me a yes, support and encouragement promptly after I sent emails. Thanks a lot for spending your free time organising cool events and sharing the videos to the community. I really appreciate. This website is just a curation to videos, it does not repost or claim copyright of any of the videos. And there are links back to conference and meetup pages. It is free to use and has no commercial purpose. Hope you find the website useful as I do. There are of course many things needed to improve, I‚Äôm looking forward to receiving feedbacks and support from you ‚ù§Ô∏è If there are any issues or copyright violations, please feel free to drop me a message.","link":"/blog/Introducing-Learn-Talks-Awesome-conference-and-meetup-talks/"},{"title":"Law of Jante","text":"Issue #9 The other day I was watching Inside Sweden‚Äôs Silicon Valley, and he mentions Law of Jante It is pretty much this You‚Äôre not to think you are anything special.

If packets arrive too late then they are discarded. A jitter buffer may be mis-configured and be either too large or too small. ImpactIf a jitter buffer is too small then an excessive number of packets may be discarded, which can lead to call quality degradation. Lower settings cause less delay in the meeting, but meetings with lower settings are more susceptible to jitter effects caused by network congestion. Less data is buffered, increasing the likelihood that delayed or lost packets will produce a jitter effect in the media stream. If a jitter buffer is too large then the additional delay can lead to conversational difficulty. Higher settings are more effective at reducing jitter effects. With higher settings, more data is buffered, which allows more time for delayed packets to arrive at the client. However, higher settings also result in more delay (or latency) in the meeting. A user who is speaking will not be heard immediately by the other meeting participants. The delay in the meeting increases with the amount of time that data is held in the buffer. ResolutionA typical jitter buffer configuration is 30mS to 50mS in size. In the case of an adaptive jitter buffer then the maximum size may be set to 100-200mS. Note that if the jitter buffer size exceeds 100mS then the additional delay introduced can lead to conversational difficulty.

Well, when the Swift compiler goes to import a module, it looks for a file called the Compiled Module for that library. If it finds one of these files, it reads off the manifest of public APIs that you can call into, and lets you use them. Now, this Compiled Module Format is a binary format that basically contains internal compiler data structures. And since they‚Äôre just internal data structures, they‚Äôre subject to change with every version of the Swift Compiler. So what this means is that if one person tries to import a module using one version of Swift, and that module was created by another version of Swift, their compiler can‚Äôt understand it, and they won‚Äôt be able to use it. Well, in order to solve this version lock, Xcode 11 introduces a new format for Swift Modules, called Swift Module Interfaces. And just like the Compiled Module Format, they list out all the public APIs of a module, but in a textual form that behaves more like source code. And since they behave like source code, then future versions of the Swift Compiler will be able to import module interfaces created with older versions.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a link layer procotol, it is used for resolving network layer address (IP) into link layer address (MAC). When we want to send IP packet to another host (a computer in the same LAN, or the Gateway), we must know the destination IP address. In order for the packet to reach the destination, the destination IP address must be converted to the corresponding MAC address, so the transmission can be processed in the data link layer. To setup this mapping IP-MAC in the ARP table, we must first send ARP request as broadcast one to the LAN. In the happy case, the one with the IP in the ARP request will reply us with his MAC address. Unfortunately, ARP is a stateless protocol. This means we continue to accept ARP replies and overwrite the old ones, even they have not expired yet. Worse, ARP does not define any authentication method to check whether the replies come from the trusted one (the one we want to receive the replies). These offer chances for the attacker to perform ARP Spoofing. The theory behind ARP SpoofingFrom the machine in the LAN, the attacker associate his MAC address and IP address of the target host (usually the Gateway), so that any traffic sent to that target host will come to the attacker. Here the attacker can decide whether to modify the packet, send or not. There are 3 types of ARP Spoofing Spoof the host computer Spoof the Gateway Spoof both the host computer and the Gateway To see the ARP tableOpen Command line (Windows) or Terminal (Mac OSX), and type 1arp -a This will list the MAC address associated with a specific IP. Note that some mappings maybe wrong due to ARP Spoofing How to prevent against this ?To prevent spoofing our computer, we can use softwares (search for Anti Netcut, Anti ARP spoofing, ‚Ä¶) or set the static ARP ourselves. In fact, those softwares are based on setting static ARP. This way we set the static mapping IP-MAC for a specific host (computer or Gateway), and the OS definitely ignores all ARP replies for that IP. Example of static ARP mapping associated with the Gateway, performed on the computer host 1192.168.1.1 B4-B3-62-7C-CE-55 Here 192.168.1.1 and B4-B3-62-7C-CE-55 are the Gateway‚Äôs IP and MAC address To prevent spoofing the Gateway, we must set static ARP on that Gateway. Go to the Gateway/Router interface, in its ARP setting, fill in the mapping IP-MAC for a specific host Look for that Gateway manual or the related guide on how to perform this. This is devices dependent-method, but the theory remains the same. Example of static ARP mapping associated with the computer host, performed on the Gateway 1192.168.1.2 64-70-02-B2-9B-E1 Here 192.168.1.2 and 64-70-02-B2-9B-E1 are the machine host ‚Äòs IP and MAC address.

For most purposes, the actual size of a point is irrelevant. The goal of points is to provide a relatively consistent scale that you can use in your code to specify the size and position of views and rendered content On a standard-resolution screen, the scale factor is typically 1.0.

As someone who worked with many apps that involve media playback, here are some of my observations MPMoviePlayerController vs AVPlayerAt first, I use MPMoviePlayerController because it is very simple, in fact, it is a wrapper around AVPlayer. It offers a lot of useful notifications and properties. But when my requirements change, a lot more features are needed, I need to change to AVPlayer to have more control. And that is the wisest decision I‚Äôve ever made You should use AVPlayer as soon as possible. Using it cost you just a little longer time than MPMoviePlayerController, but you have a lot of control. Custom controlsWhen building your own player, the built in controls of MPMoviePlayerController may not satisfy your need. I see many questions on SO are about custom controls. MPMoviePlayerControllerYou have to set controlStyle to MPMovieControlStyleNone, set up Timer because currentPlaybackTime is not KVO compliance AVPlayerAVPlayer has no built in controls, but it has addPeriodicTimeObserverForInterval:queue:usingBlock: that makes handling the current time easily.

For Xcode 7, the SDK is iOS 9 If we upgrade Xcode, it will use the newer version of the SDK. Like Xcode 7.2, the SDK is iOS 9.1 Choosing the latest SDK for your project lets you use the new APIs introduced in the OS update that corresponds to that SDK. When new functionality is added as part of a system update, the system update itself does not typically contain updated header files reflecting the change. The SDKs, however, do contain updated header files. Deployment Target We can set in Xcode -&gt; Target -&gt; Deployment Info -&gt; Deployment Target State that we support this iOS version What does it mean So, a modern App might use iOS 9 as the Target SDK, and iOS 7 as the deployment target. This means that you can run on iOS 7, iOS 8 and iOS 9, and that you have available to you any iOS 9 calls when actually running on iOS 9. . Each .sdk directory resembles the directory hierarchy of the operating system release it represents: It has usr, System, and Developer directories at its top level. OS X .sdk directories also contain a Library directory. Each of these directories in turn contains subdirectories with the headers and libraries that are present in the corresponding version of the operating system with Xcode installed. . The libraries in an iOS or OS X SDK are stubs for linking only; they do not contain executable code but just the exported symbols. SDK support works only with native build targets. So the SDK is just like stub and header only. It means that we can use certain APIs, but on OS that does not have the real symbols for those APIs, it crashes availableSwift 2 introduces available construct that guards against failure when trying to use newer APIs. Note that available is runtime, not compile time. All the code is inside your executable 12345if #available(iOS 9, OSX 10.10, *) { // Code to execute on iOS 9, OS X 10.10} else {} deprecated APIs Finding Instances of Deprecated API Usage Always check to see if you are using deprecated APIs; though still available, deprecated APIs are not guaranteed to be available in the future Compile time vs Runtime Conditionally Compiling for Different SDKs 12345#if (arch(i386) || arch(x86_64)) &amp;&amp; os(iOS) // code inside gets inserted into executable when builds for simulator#else // code inside gets inserted into executable when builds for device#endif 12345#if os(OSX) import Cocoa#elseif os(iOS) import UIKit#endif 123456// All the code gets inserted into executable, but is run depending on the version of the OSif #available(iOS 9, *) { // use UIStackView} else { // show your manual Auto Layout skill} Weakly vs strongly linked Weak Linking and Apple Frameworks What does it mean to ‚Äúweak-link‚Äù a framework? Frameworks and Weak Linking For example, suppose in Xcode you set the deployment target (minimum required version) to ‚ÄúOS X v10.5‚Äù and the base SDK (maximum allowed version) to ‚ÄúOS X v10.6‚Äù. During compilation, the compiler would weakly link interfaces that were introduced in OS X v10.6 while strongly linking interfaces defined in earlier versions of the OS. This would allow your application to run in OS X v10.5 and take advantage of newer features when available. . None of the (platform) frameworks is really ‚Äúincluded in the bundle‚Äù. Instead, your app has a reference (‚Äúlink‚Äù) to a framework once you add it to the ‚ÄúLink Binary with Library‚Äù build phase. The frameworks are pre-installed on the devices. When you run an app, all the app‚Äôs framework references are resolved by the dynamic linker (on the device), which means the framework code is loaded so your app can use it.

But with the help of those geeks on SO, the problems were demystified. Now it‚Äôs time to sum up and share with others :D What defines a unique connection ?There are 5 elements that identify a connection. They call them 5-tuple Protocol. This is often omitted as it is understood that we are talking about TCP, which leaves 4. Source IP address. Source port. Target P address. Target port. Does TCP listen on one port and talk on another port ?No. This is a common misconception. TCP listens on 1 port and talk on that same port. If clients make multiple TCP connection to server. It‚Äôs the client OS that must generate different random source ports, so that server can see them as unique connections What is the maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that a server can handle, in theory ?A single listening port can accept more than one connection simultaneously.There is a ‚Äò64K‚Äô limit that is often cited, but that is per client per server port, and needs clarifying. If a client has many connections to the same port on the same destination, then three of those fields will be the same ‚Äî only source_port varies to differentiate the different connections. Ports are 16-bit numbers, therefore the maximum number of connections any given client can have to any given host port is 64K. However, multiple clients can each have up to 64K connections to some server‚Äôs port, and if the server has multiple ports or either is multi-homed then you can multiply that further So the real limit is file descriptors. Each individual socket connection is given a file descriptor, so the limit is really the number of file descriptors that the system has been configured to allow and resources to handle. The maximum limit is typically up over 300K, but is configurable e.g. with sysctl Concurrent connection request vs Concurrent open connectionWhen clients want to make TCP connection with server, this request will be queued in server ‚Äòs backlog queue. This backlog queue size is small (about 5‚Äì10), and this size limits the number of concurrent connection requests. However, server quickly pick connection request from that queue and accept it. Connection request which is accepted are called open connection. The number of concurrent open connections is limited by server ‚Äòs resources allocated for file descriptor. Why connection is rejected after successful TCP handshake ?It‚Äôs normal. When server receive connection request from client (by receiving SYN), it will then response with SYN, ACK, hence cause successful TCP handshake. But this request are stills in backlog queue. But, if the application process exceeds the limit of max file descriptors it can use, then when server calls accept, then it realizes that there are no file descriptors available to be the allocated for the socket and fails the accept call and the TCP connection sending a FIN to other side What are active and passive socket ?Sockets come in two primary flavors. An active socket is con¬≠nect¬≠ed to a remote active socket via an open data con¬≠nec¬≠tion‚Ä¶ A passive socket is not con¬≠nect¬≠ed, but rather awaits an in¬≠com¬≠ing con¬≠nec¬≠tion, which will spawn a new active socket once a con¬≠nec¬≠tion is es¬≠tab¬≠lished Each port can have a single passive socket binded to it, await¬≠ing in¬≠com¬≠ing con¬≠nec¬≠tions, and mul¬≠ti¬≠ple active sockets, each cor¬≠re¬≠spond¬≠ing to an open con¬≠nec¬≠tion on the port. It‚Äôs as if the factory worker is waiting for new mes¬≠sages to arrive (he rep¬≠re¬≠sents the passive socket), and when one message arrives from a new sender, he ini¬≠ti¬≠ates a cor¬≠re¬≠spon¬≠dence (a con¬≠nec¬≠tion) with them by del¬≠e¬≠gat¬≠ing someone else (an active socket) to ac¬≠tu¬≠al¬≠ly read the packet and respond back to the sender if nec¬≠es¬≠sary.

The thread is returned to the pool while the coroutine is waiting, and when the waiting is done, the coroutine resumes on a free thread in the pool. await() can not be called outside a coroutine, because it needs to suspend until the computation finishes, and only coroutines can suspend in a non-blocking way What does suspend function mean in Kotlin Coroutine ü§îhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/47871868/what-does-suspend-function-mean-in-kotlin-coroutine I‚Äôm reading Kotlin Coroutine and know that it is based on suspend function. But what does suspend mean? Coroutine or function gets suspended? From https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html Basically, coroutines are computations that can be suspended without blocking a thread I heard people often say ‚Äúsuspend function‚Äù. But I think it is the coroutine who gets suspended because it is waiting for the function to finished? ‚Äúsuspend‚Äù usually means ‚Äúcease operation‚Äù, in this case the coroutine is idle. Should we say the coroutine is suspended ? Which coroutine gets suspended? From https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html To continue the analogy, await() can be a suspending function (hence also callable from within an async {} block) that suspends a coroutine until some computation is done and returns its result: 123456async { // Here I call it the outer async coroutine ... // Here I call computation the inner coroutine val result = computation.await() ...} ü§î It says ‚Äúthat suspends a coroutine until some computation is done‚Äù, but coroutine is like a lightweight thread. So if the coroutine is suspended, how can the computation is done ? We see await is called on computation, so it might be async that returns Deferred, which means it can start another coroutine 12345fun computation(): Deferred&lt;Boolean&gt; { return async { true }} ü§î The quote say that suspends a coroutine. Does it mean suspend the outer async coroutine, or suspend the inner computation coroutine? Does suspend mean that while outer async coroutine is waiting (await) for the inner computation coroutine to finish, it (the outer async coroutine) idles (hence the name suspend) and returns thread to the thread pool, and when the child computation coroutine finishes, it (the outer async coroutine) wakes up, takes another thread from the pool and continues? The reason I mention the thread is because of https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/coroutines-basic-jvm.html The thread is returned to the pool while the coroutine is waiting, and when the waiting is done, the coroutine resumes on a free thread in the pool Understanding asyncFrom https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/coroutines-guide.md Conceptually, async is just like launch. It starts a separate coroutine which is a light-weight thread that works concurrently with all the other coroutines. The difference is that launch returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value, while async returns a Deferred ‚Äì a light-weight non-blocking future that represents a promise to provide a result later. You can use .await() on a deferred value to get its eventual result, but Deferred is also a Job, so you can cancel it if needed. 12345678fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) = runBlocking&lt;Unit&gt; { val time = measureTimeMillis { val one = async { doSomethingUsefulOne() } val two = async { doSomethingUsefulTwo() } println(\"The answer is ${one.await() + two.await()}\") } println(\"Completed in $time ms\")} There is a laziness option to async using an optional start parameter with a value of CoroutineStart.LAZY. It starts coroutine only when its result is needed by some await or if a start function is invoked. Run the following example that differs from the previous one only by this option: 12345678fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) = runBlocking&lt;Unit&gt; { val time = measureTimeMillis { val one = async(start = CoroutineStart.LAZY) { doSomethingUsefulOne() } val two = async(start = CoroutineStart.LAZY) { doSomethingUsefulTwo() } println(\"The answer is ${one.await() + two.await()}\") } println(\"Completed in $time ms\")} What is the difference between launch/join and async/await in Kotlin coroutineshttps://stackoverflow.com/a/48079738/1418457 I find this guide https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/coroutines-guide.md to be useful. I will quote the essential parts ü¶Ñ coroutine Essentially, coroutines are light-weight threads. So you can think of coroutine as something that manages thread in a very efficient way. üê§ launch 12345678fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) { launch { // launch new coroutine in background and continue delay(1000L) // non-blocking delay for 1 second (default time unit is ms) println(\"World!\") // print after delay } println(\"Hello,\") // main thread continues while coroutine is delayed Thread.sleep(2000L) // block main thread for 2 seconds to keep JVM alive} So launch starts a background thread, does something, and returns a token immediately as Job. You can call join on this Job to block until this launch thread completes 12345678fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) = runBlocking&lt;Unit&gt; { val job = launch { // launch new coroutine and keep a reference to its Job delay(1000L) println(\"World!\") } println(\"Hello,\") job.join() // wait until child coroutine completes} ü¶Ü async Conceptually, async is just like launch. It starts a separate coroutine which is a light-weight thread that works concurrently with all the other coroutines. The difference is that launch returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value, while async returns a Deferred ‚Äì a light-weight non-blocking future that represents a promise to provide a result later. So async starts a background thread, does something, and returns a token immediately as Deferred. 12345678fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) = runBlocking&lt;Unit&gt; { val time = measureTimeMillis { val one = async { doSomethingUsefulOne() } val two = async { doSomethingUsefulTwo() } println(\"The answer is ${one.await() + two.await()}\") } println(\"Completed in $time ms\")} You can use .await() on a deferred value to get its eventual result, but Deferred is also a Job, so you can cancel it if needed. So Deferred is actually a Job. See https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.experimental/-deferred/index.html 1interface Deferred&lt;out T&gt; : Job (source) ü¶ã async is eager by default There is a laziness option to async using an optional start parameter with a value of CoroutineStart.LAZY. It starts coroutine only when its result is needed by some await or if a start function is invoked.

To avoid retain cycle you often see the weakSelf - strongSelf dance like this 123456__weak __typeof__(self) weakSelf = self; self.block = ^{ __typeof__(self) strongSelf = weakSelf; [strongSelf doSomething]; [strongSelf doSomethingElse]; }; When block is createdBlock is object when it is copiedBlocks are created on the stack and will go away when their stack frame returns. While on the stack, a block has no effect on the storage or lifetime of anything it accesses. If blocks need to exist after the stack frame returns, they can be copied to the heap and this action is an explicit operation. This way, a block will gain reference-counting as all objects in Cocoa. When they are copied, they take their captured scope with them, retaining any objects they refer Blocks can capture values from the enclosing scopeAs well as containing executable code, a block also has the ability to capture state from its enclosing scope. Note that block captures the variable along with its decorators (i.e. weak qualifier), =&gt; This explains why you need to declare self as __weak When block is executedWhen block is executed, it is possible for weakSelf to be non-nil for the first method (doSomething), but not for the second (doSomethingElse) You may think, at first, this is a trick to use self inside the block avoiding the retain cycle warning. This is not the case. The strong reference to self is created at block execution time while using self in the block is evaluated at block declaration time, thus retaining the object. For best practice, however, you should create a strong reference of your object using the weak one. This won‚Äôt create a retain cycle either as the strong pointer within the block will only exist until the block completes (it‚Äôs only scope is the block itself). =&gt; This explains why you need to declare another __strong self More explanationThis is my answer to reader Nikita As many people point out, ‚ÄúBlocks are created on the stack and will go away when their stack frame returns. While on the stack, a block has no effect on the storage or lifetime of anything it accesses.‚ÄùEven if block (declared on the stack) increase reference count to all the object it accesses, this would be useless, because this block will be discard when function returns When block are copied (You see that people usually declare property (copy) for block), it will increase reference count to all the objects it accesses. Why? because block are mean to be executed at a later time, so it need to keep strong reference to all the object it access. Block can be executed MANY TIMES, so IT WON‚ÄôT RELEASE self AFTER this ran. When you nil out the block, it will be dealloc, hence it will decrease the reference count to all the objects it access. AFNetworking nil out the block after it is called, so you don‚Äôt have to use weakself inside block http://www.fantageek.com/1376/afnetworking-gotcha-2/ So there are cases when you don‚Äôt have to use weakself inside blocka. Make sure the block is not copied, you simply declare and run itb.

See Kotlin Style guide, I think this guide should be applied in other languages, such as Swift üòõ Sometimes there is more than one reasonable way to convert an English phrase into camel case, such as when acronyms or unusual constructs like ‚ÄúIPv6‚Äù or ‚ÄúiOS‚Äù are present. To improve predictability, use the following scheme. Beginning with the prose form of the name: Convert the phrase to plain ASCII and remove any apostrophes. For example, ‚ÄúM√ºller‚Äôs algorithm‚Äù might become ‚ÄúMuellers algorithm‚Äù. Divide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining punctuation (typically hyphens). Recommended: if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., ‚ÄúAdWords‚Äù becomes ‚Äúad words‚Äù). Note that a word such as ‚ÄúiOS‚Äù is not really in camel case per se; it defies any convention, so this recommendation does not apply. Now lowercase everything (including acronyms), then uppercase only the first character of: ‚Ä¶each word, to yield pascal case, or ‚Ä¶each word except the first, to yield camel case Finally, join all the words into a single identifier.

Swift allows you to represent real world objects that have some characteristics and can perform some action. I tend to think of an app as a world where each object is a person. They work and communicate. If a person can‚Äôt do the work alone, he needs to ask for help. Take a project, for example, if the manager has to do all of the work by himself, he will go crazy. So there is a need to organise and delegate tasks, and for many persons to collaborate on the project: designer, tester, scrum master, developer. After the task is done, the manager needs to be informed. This may not a good example. But at least you get the importance of communication and delegation in OOP. I was very intrigued by the word ‚Äúarchitecture‚Äù when I started iOS programming. But after doing for a while, it all comes down to identifying and splitting responsibilities. This article tells a bit about MVC and simple Extract Classrefactoring to MVVM, and how to go further with Rx. You are free to create your own architecture, but whatever you do, consistence is key as to not confuse or surprise your teammates. Model View ControllerTake a look at the architecture you know the best, MVC, short for Model View Controller. You always get one when you create a new iOS project. View is where you present your data, using UIView, UIButton, UILabel. Model is just a fancy word for data. It can be your entity, data from networking, object from database, or from cache. The controller is the thing that mediates between the model and the view. UIViewController is the center of the universeThe problem with ViewController is that it tends to be huge. Apple puts it as the center of the universe, where it has lots of properties and responsibilities. There are many things that you can only do with a UIViewController. Things like interacting with storyboard, managing the view, configuring view rotation, state restoration. UIViewController is designed with lots of hooks for you to override and customize. Take a look at the many sections in UIViewController documentation, you can‚Äôt do the following without a UIViewController. func viewDidLoad() var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle { get } UITableViewDataSource var presentationController: UIPresentationController? { get } func childViewControllerForScreenEdgesDeferringSystemGestures() -&gt; UIViewController? func didMove(toParentViewController parent: UIViewController?) var systemMinimumLayoutMargins: NSDirectionalEdgeInsets var edgesForExtendedLayout: UIRectEdge var previewActionItems: [UIPreviewActionItem] var navigationItem: UINavigationItem var shouldAutorotate: BoolAs your app grows, we need to add more code for other logic. Such as networking, data source, handling multiple delegates, presenting child view controllers. We can, of course, put all the stuff on the view controller, but that results in big view controller and improvement in your scrolling skill. This is where you lose the big picture of responsibilities because all stuff stays in the mega view controller. You tend to introduce code duplication and bugs are hard to fix because they are all over the places. The same goes with Page in Windows Phone or Activity in Android. They are intended for a screen or partial screen of functionality. There are certain actions that can only be done through them like Page.OnNavigatedTo, Activity.onCreate. The buzzwords of architectureWhat do you do when the ViewController is doing a lot? You offset the work to other components. By the way, if you want another object to do the user input handling, you can use the Presenter. If the Presenter is doing too much, then it can offset the business logic to the Interactor. Also, there are more buzzwords that can be used. let buzzWords = [ &quot;Model&quot;, &quot;View&quot;, &quot;Controller&quot;, &quot;Entity&quot;, &quot;Router&quot;, &quot;Clean&quot;, &quot;Reactive&quot;, &quot;Presenter&quot;, &quot;Interactor&quot;, &quot;Megatron&quot;, &quot;Coordinator&quot;, &quot;Flow&quot;, &quot;Manager&quot; ] let architecture = buzzWords.shuffled().takeRandom() let acronym = architecture.makeAcronym() After all the buzzwords are assembled, we get an architecture. There are many of them, ranging from simple extract class refactoring, embracing MVC or taking inspiration from Clean Code, Rx, EventBus or Redux. The choice depends on project, and some teams prefer one architecture over the other. The pragmatic programmerPeople have different opinion about what is good architecture. For me, it is about clear separation of concern, good communication pattern and being comfortable to use. Each component in the architecture should be identifiable and have a specific role. The communication must be clear so that we know which object is talking to each other. This together with good dependency injection will make testing easier. Things that sound good in theory may not work well in practice. Separated domain objects are cool, protocol extensions are cool, multiple layers of abstraction are cool. But too many of them can be a problem. If you read enough about design patterns, you know they all come down to these simple principles: Encapsulate what varies: identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. Program to an interface, not an implementation Prefer composition over inheritance If there‚Äôs one thing we should master, it‚Äôs composition. The key is to identify responsibility and compose them in a reasonable and consistent way. Consult with your team mates on what suits the most. Always writing code with the thought that you will also be the future maintainer. Then you will write it differently. Don‚Äôt fight against the systemSome architectures introduce completely new paradigm. Some of them are cumbersome that there people write scripts to generate boiler plate code. It‚Äôs good that there are many approaches to a problem. But for me sometimes it feels they are fighting the system. Some tasks are made easy while some trivial tasks become extremely hard. We should not constrain ourselves to one architecture simply because it are trendy. Be pragmatic, not dogmatic. In iOS, we should embrace MVC. UIViewController is not meant for a full screen of content. They can contain and be composed to split the functionalities. We can use Coordinator and FlowController to manage dependencies and handle flow. Containerfor state transition, embedded logic controller, part of full screen content. This embracing ViewController approach play nicely with MVC in iOS and is my preferable way of doing. Model View ViewModel Another good-enough way is to offload some of the tasks to another object, let‚Äôs call it ViewModel. The name does not matter, you can name it Reactor, Maestro, Dinosaur. The important thing is your team get an agreed name. ViewModel takes some tasks from the ViewController and reports when it‚Äôs done. There are communication patterns in Cocoa Touch such as delegate, closures to use. ViewModel is self-contained, has no reference to UIKit, and has just input and output. We can put a lot of things into ViewModel like calculation, formatting, networking, business logic. Also, if you don‚Äôt like the ViewModel to become massive, you surely need to create some dedicated objects. ViewModel is the first step to get a slim ViewController. SynchronouslyBelow is a very simple ViewModel, which formats data based on User model. This is done synchronously. class ProfileController: UIViewController { override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() let viewModel = ViewModel(user: user) nameLabel.text = viewModel.name birthdayLabel.text = viewModel.birthdayString salaryLabel.text = viewModel.salary piLabel.text = viewModel.millionthDigitOfPi } }AsynchronouslyWe work with asynchronous API all the time. What if we want to show the user‚Äôs number of Facebook friends? For this to work we need to call Facebook API and this operation takes time. The ViewModel can report back via closure. viewModel.getFacebookFriends { friends in self.friendCountLabel.text = &quot;\\(friends.count)&quot; }Internally, the ViewModel may offload the task to a dedicated Facebook API client object. class ViewModel { func getFacebookFriends(completion: [User] -&gt; Void) { let client = APIClient() client.getFacebookFriends(for: user) { friends in DispatchQueue.main.async { completion(friends) } } } }Jetpack in Android Google introduced Android Architecture Component, now part of Jetpack, at Google IO 2017. It has ViewModel and LiveData, which is also a type of MVVM applied in Android. ViewModel survives through configuration changes, and notify results in terms of LiveData for Activity to consume. class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() { override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?, persistentState: PersistableBundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState, persistentState) val model = ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(MyViewModel::class.java) model.getUsers().observe(this, { users -&gt; // update UI }) } }This is one of the reason I like ViewModel. If we follow ViewModel like this, then code structures between iOS and Android become similar. There should be no need for some random Javascript cross platform solutions. You learn the concept once, and apply it on both iOS and Android. I learn ViewModel, RxSwift on iOS and feel right at home when I work with RxJava and RxBinding on Android. The Kickstarter project also proves that this works well in their iOS and Android apps. BindingTo encapsulate the closure, we can create a class called Binding, which can notify one or multiple listeners. It takes advantage of didSet, and the observable property becomes clear. class Binding&lt;T&gt; { var value: T { didSet { listener?(value) } } private var listener: ((T) -&gt; Void)? init(value: T) { self.value = value } func bind(_ closure: @escaping (T) -&gt; Void) { closure(value) listener = closure } }Here is how to use it inside ViewModel: class ViewModel { let friends = Binding&lt;[User]&gt;(value: []) init() { getFacebookFriends { friends.value = $0 } } func getFacebookFriends(completion: ([User]) -&gt; Void) { // Do the work } }When ever friends are fetched, or changed, the ViewController is updated accordingly. This is called reaction to changes. override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() viewModel.friends.bind { friends in self.friendsCountLabel.text = &quot;\\(friends.count)&quot; } }You often see MVVM introduction with reactive frameworks, and it is for a reason. They offer many chaining operators and make reactive programming easier and more declarative. RxSwiftPerhaps the most common reactive framework in Swift is RxSwift. The thing I like about it is that it follows ReactiveX pattern. So you will feel more familiar if you already use RxJava, RxJs, or RxKotlin. Observable RxSwift unifies sync and async operations through Observable. This is how you make one. class ViewModel { let friends: Observable&lt;[User]&gt; init() { let client = APIClient() friends = Observable&lt;[User]&gt;.create({ subscriber in client.getFacebookFriends(completion: { friends in subscriber.onNext(friends) subscriber.onCompleted() }) return Disposables.create() }) } }The power of RxSwift lies in its numerous operators, which help you chain Observables. Here you can call 2 network requests, wait for both of them to finish, then sum up the friends. This is very streamlined and saves you lots of time. Here you can just subscribe to the Observable, it will be triggered when the request completes: override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() viewModel.friends.subscribe(onNext: { friends in self.friendsCountLabel.text = &quot;\\(friends.count)&quot; }) }Input and outputOne thing that is nice about ViewModel and Rx is that we can separate input and output using Observable, which gives a clear interface. Read more at Learning from Open Source: Input and output container. Below it is clear that we fetch is an input, and friends is the viable output. class ViewModel { class Input { let fetch = PublishSubject&lt;()&gt;() } class Output { let friends: Driver&lt;[User]&gt; } let apiClient: APIClient let input: Input let output: Output init(apiClient: APIClient) { self.apiClient = apiClient // Connect input and output } } class ProfileViewController: BaseViewController&lt;ProfileView&gt; { let viewModel: ProfileViewModelType init(viewModel: ProfileViewModelType) { self.viewModel = viewModel } override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // Input viewModel.input.fetch.onNext(()) // Output viewModel.output.friends.subscribe(onNext: { friends in self.friendsCountLabel.text = &quot;\\(friends.count)&quot; }) } }How reactive worksIf you feel like Rx, it‚Äôs good to get an understanding of them after using some frameworks for a while. There are some concepts like Signal, SignalProducer, Observable, Promise, Future, Task, Job, Launcher, Async and some people can have a very distinction about them. Here I simply call it Signal, which is something that can signal values. MonadSignal and its Result are just monads, which are thing that can be mapped and chained. Signal makes use of deferred execution callback closures. It can be pushed or pulled. Which is just how the Signal updates its value and the order the callbacks are called. Execution callback closure means that we pass a function to another function. And the passed in function will get called when appropriated. Sync vs AsyncMonad can be in either sync or async mode. Sync is easier to understand, but async is somewhat you‚Äôre already familiar and used in practice. Basically, Sync: you get the returned value right away via return Async: you get the returned value via callback block Here is an example of simple sync and async free functions: // Sync func sum(a: Int, b: Int) -&gt; Int { return a + b } // Async func sum(a: Int, b: Int, completion: Int -&gt; Void) { // Assumed it is a very long task to get the result let result = a + b completion(result) }And how sync and async apply to Result type. Notice the async version, we get the transformed value in a completion closure instead of immediate return from function. enum Result&lt;T&gt; { case value(value: T) case failure(error: Error) // Sync public func map&lt;U&gt;(f: (T) -&gt; U) -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt; { switch self { case let .value(value): return .value(value: f(value)) case let .failure(error): return .failure(error: error) } } // Async public func map&lt;U&gt;(f: @escaping ((T), (U) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) -&gt; (((Result&lt;U&gt;) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) { return { g in // g: Result&lt;U&gt; -&gt; Void switch self { case let .value(value): f(value) { transformedValue in // transformedValue: U g(.value(value: transformedValue)) } case let .failure(error): g(.failure(error: error)) } } } }Push SignalGiven a chained signals like this: A -(map)-&gt; B -(flatMap)-&gt; C -(flatMap)-&gt; D -(subscribe) Push Signal, means that when the source signal A is sent an event, it propagates that event via callbacks. PushSignal is similar to PublishSubject in RxSwift. Triggered by sending event to the source signal. We must keep A as it keeps the others around We subscribe the last D We send event to the first A A ‚Äòs callback gets called, it it in turn calls callback of B with the result of A ‚Äòs map, then B ‚Äòs callback calls C ‚Äòs callback with the result of B‚Äòs flatMap, and so on. It is similar to Promise A+, you can see my Swift implementation of Promise A+ in my Then framework. For now, here is the Swift 4 implementation of a simple PushSignal. public final class PushSignal&lt;T&gt; { var event: Result&lt;T&gt;? var callbacks: [(Result&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Void] = [] let lockQueue = DispatchQueue(label: &quot;Serial Queue&quot;) func notify() { guard let event = event else { return } callbacks.forEach { callback in callback(event) } } func update(event: Result&lt;T&gt;) { lockQueue.sync { self.event = event } notify() } public func subscribe(f: @escaping (Result&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Signal&lt;T&gt; { // Callback if let event = event { f(event) } callbacks.append(f) return self } public func map&lt;U&gt;(f: @escaping (T) -&gt; U) -&gt; Signal&lt;U&gt; { let signal = Signal&lt;U&gt;() _ = subscribe { event in signal.update(event: event.map(f: f)) } return signal } }Below is how a PushSignal is used to transform a chain from string to its length, you should see 4, the length of the string ‚Äútest‚Äù printed. let signal = PushSignal&lt;String&gt;() _ = signal.map { value in return value.count }.subscribe { event in if case let .value(value) = event { print(value) } else { print(&quot;error&quot;) } } signal.update(event: .value(value: &quot;test&quot;))Pull SignalGiven a chained signals like this: A -(map)-&gt; B -(flatMap)-&gt; C -(flatMap)-&gt; D -(subscribe) Pull Signal, sometimes called Future, means when we subscribe to the final signal D, it causes the previous signals to action: Triggered by subscribing to the final signal D; We must keep D as it keeps the others around; We subscribe the last D; D ‚Äòs operation runs, and it cause C ‚Äòs operation to runs, ‚Ä¶ then A ‚Äòs operation runs. It is in A that the task is performed (like fetching network, retrieving database, file access, heavy computation, ‚Ä¶) to get the result, and A ‚Äòs completion gets called. Then A‚Äôs completion calls B ‚Äòs completion with the result mapped by B ‚Äòs map, ‚Ä¶ all the way to the subscriber ‚Äòs completion block. Here is a Swift 4 implementation of PullSignal. PullSignal is similar to Observablein RxSwift and SignalProducer in ReactiveSwift. public struct PullSignal&lt;T&gt; { let operation: ((Result&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void public init(operation: @escaping ((Result&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) { self.operation = operation } public func start(completion: (Result&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Void) { operation() { event in completion(event) } } public func map&lt;U&gt;(f: @escaping (T) -&gt; U) -&gt; PullSignal&lt;U&gt; { return PullSignal&lt;U&gt; { completion in self.start { event in completion(event.map(f: f)) } } } }The chain is inactive until you call start at the last signal in the chain, which triggers operation flow all over to the first signal. Run this snippet and you should see 4, the length of the string ‚Äútest‚Äù printed on the console. let signal = PullSignal&lt;String&gt; { completion in // There should be some long running operation here completion(Result.value(value: &quot;test&quot;)) } signal.map { value in value.count }.start { event in if case let .value(value) = event { print(value) } else { print(&quot;error&quot;) } }I hope those snippets are simple enough to help you understand how signal works under the hood, and how to differentiate hot and cold signals. To get a fully working Signal framework, you need to implement more operations. Such as retry, rebounce, throttle, queue, flatten, filter, delay, combine and add support for UIKit like RxCocoa does. Find out how to implement in my Signal repo. Where to go from hereArchitecture is a very opinionated topic. Hopefully this article gives you some ideas to add into your decision points.

I‚Äôm always looking for ways to structure apps in a better way. But after some times, I see that we‚Äôre too creative in creating architecture, aka constraint, that is too far away from the platform that we‚Äôre building. I often think ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre going too far from the system, then it‚Äôs very hard to go back‚Äù I like things that embrace the system. One of them is Coordinator which helps in encapsulation and navigation. Thanks to my friend Vadym for showing me Coordinator in action. The below screenshot from @khanlou ‚Äòs talk at CocoaHeads Stockholm clearly says many things about Coordinator But after reading A Better MVC, I think we can leverage view controller containment to do navigation using UIViewController only.

Let see how FlowController fits better into MVC ¬´UIViewController is the center of the universe.¬ª‚Äî @onmyway133&mdash; Elvis Nu√±ez (@3lvis) 6. oktober 2017 1. FlowController and AppDelegateYour application starts from AppDelegate, in that you setup UIWindow. So we should follow the same ‚Äútop down‚Äù approach for FlowController, starting with AppFlowController. You can construct all dependencies that your app need for AppFlowController, so that it can pass to other child FlowController. AppDelegate is also considered Composition Root Here is how to declare AppFlowController in AppDelegate 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536struct DependencyContainer: AuthServiceContainer, PhoneServiceContainer, NetworkingServiceContainer, LocationServiceContainer, MapServiceContainer, HealthServiceContainer { let authService: AuthServiceProtocol let phoneService: PhoneService let networkingService: NetworkingService let locationService: LocationService let mapService: MapService let healthService: HealthService static func make() -&gt; DependencyContainer { // Configure and make DependencyContainer here }}@UIApplicationMainclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate { var window: UIWindow? var appFlowController: AppFlowController! func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -&gt; Bool { appFlowController = AppFlowController( dependencyContainer: DependencyContainer.make() ) window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds) window?.rootViewController = appFlowController window?.makeKeyAndVisible() appFlowController.start() return true }} Here are some hypothetical FlowController that you may encounter AppFlowController: manages UIWindow and check whether to show onboarding, login or main depending on authentication state OnboardingFlowController: manages UIPageViewController and maybe ask for some permissions LoginFlowController: manages UINavigationController to show login, sms verification, forget password, and optionally start SignUpFlowController MainFlowController: manages UITabBarController with each tab serving main features FeedFlowController: show feed with list of items ProfileFlowController: show profile SettingsFlowController: show settings, and maybe call logout, this will delegates up the FlowController chain. The cool thing about FlowController is it makes your code very self contained, and grouped by features. So it‚Äôs easy to move all related things to its own package if you like. 2. FlowController as container view controller In general, a view controller should manage either sequence or UI, but not both. Basically, FlowController is just a container view controller to solve the sequence, based on a simple concept called composition. It manages many child view controllers in its flow. Let‚Äô say we have a ProductFlowController that groups together flow related to displaying products, ProductListController, ProductDetailController, ProductAuthorController, ProductMapController, ‚Ä¶ Each can delegate to the ProductFlowController to express its intent, like ProductListController can delegate to say ‚Äúproduct did tap‚Äù, so that ProductFlowController can construct and present the next screen in the flow, based on the embedded UINavigationController inside it. Normally, a FlowController just displays 1 child FlowController at a time, so normally we can just update its frame 1234567final class AppFlowController: UIViewController { override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() { super.viewDidLayoutSubviews() childViewControllers.first?.view.frame = view.bounds }} 3. FlowController as dependency containerEach view controller inside the flow can have different dependencies, so it‚Äôs not fair if the first view controller needs to carry all the stuff just to be able to pass down to the next view controllers. Here are some dependencies ProductListController: ProductNetworkingService ProductDetailController: ProductNetworkingService, ImageDowloaderService, ProductEditService ProductAuthorController: AuthorNetworkingService, ImageDowloaderService ProductMapController: LocationService, MapService Instead the FlowController can carry all the dependencies needed for that whole flow, so it can pass down to the view controller if needed. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829struct ProductDependencyContainer { let productNetworkingService: ProductNetworkingService let imageDownloaderService: ImageDownloaderService let productEditService: ProductEditService let authorNetworkingService: AuthorNetworkingService let locationService: LocationService let mapService: MapService}class ProductFlowController { let dependencyContainer: ProductDependencyContainer init(dependencyContainer: ProductDependencyContainer) { self.dependencyContainer = dependencyContainer }}extension ProductFlowController: ProductListControllerDelegate { func productListController(_ controller: ProductListController, didSelect product: Product) { let productDetailController = ProductDetailController( productNetworkingService: dependencyContainer.productNetworkingService, productEditService: dependencyContainer.productEditService, imageDownloaderService: dependencyContainer.imageDownloaderService ) productDetailController.delegate = self embeddedNavigationController.pushViewController(productDetailController, animated: true) }} Here are some ways that you can use to pass dependencies into FlowController Using protocol compositon for dependency injection Dependency injection using factories in Swift 4. Adding or removing child FlowControllerCoordinator With Coordinator, you need to keep an array of child Coordinators, and maybe use address (=== operator) to identify them 1234567891011121314151617181920212223class Coordinator { private var children: [Coordinator] = [] func add(child: Coordinator) { guard !children.contains(where: { $0 === child }) else { return } children.append(child) } func remove(child: Coordinator) { guard let index = children.index(where: { $0 === child }) else { return } children.remove(at: index) } func removeAll() { children.removeAll() }} FlowController With FlowController, since it is UIViewController subclass, it has viewControllers to hold all those child FlowController. Just add these extensions to simplify your adding or removing of child UIViewController 12345678910111213extension UIViewController { func add(childController: UIViewController) { addChildViewController(childController) view.addSubview(childController.view) childController.didMove(toParentViewController: self) } func remove(childController: UIViewController) { childController.willMove(toParentViewController: nil) childController.view.removeFromSuperview() childController.removeFromParentViewController() }} And see in action how AppFlowController work with adding 1234567891011121314151617181920212223final class AppFlowController: UIViewController { func start() { if authService.isAuthenticated { startMain() } else { startLogin() } } private func startLogin() { let loginFlowController = LoginFlowController( loginFlowController.delegate = self add(childController: loginFlowController) loginFlowController.start() } fileprivate func startMain() { let mainFlowController = MainFlowController() mainFlowController.delegate = self add(childController: mainFlowController) mainFlowController.start() }} and with removing when the child FlowController finishes 123456extension AppFlowController: LoginFlowControllerDelegate { func loginFlowControllerDidFinish(_ flowController: LoginFlowController) { remove(childController: flowController) startMain() }} 5. AppFlowController does not need to know about UIWindowCoordinator Usually you have an AppCoordinator, which is held by AppDelegate, as the root of your Coordinator chain. Based on login status, it will determine which LoginController or MainController will be set as the rootViewController, in order to do that, it needs to be injected a UIWindow 1234window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)appCoordinator = AppCoordinator(window: window!)appCoordinator.start()window?.makeKeyAndVisible() You can guess that in the start method of AppCoordinator, it must set rootViewController before window?.makeKeyAndVisible() is called. 123456789101112131415final class AppCoordinator: Coordinator { private let window: UIWindow init(window: UIWindow) { self.window = window } func start() { if dependencyContainer.authService.isAuthenticated { startMain() } else { startLogin() } }} FlowController But with AppFlowController, you can treat it like a normal UIViewController, so just setting it as the rootViewController 123456appFlowController = AppFlowController(window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)window?.rootViewController = appFlowControllerwindow?.makeKeyAndVisible()appFlowController.start() 6. LoginFlowController can manage its own flowSupposed we have login flow based on UINavigationController that can display LoginController, ForgetPasswordController, SignUpController Coordinator What should we do in the start method of LoginCoordinator? Construct the initial controller LoginController and set it as the rootViewController of the UINavigationController? LoginCoordinator can create this embedded UINavigationController internally, but then it is not attached to the rootViewController of UIWindow, because UIWindow is kept privately inside the parent AppCoordinator. We can pass UIWindow to LoginCoordinator but then it knows too much. One way is to construct UINavigationController from AppCoordinator and pass that to LoginCoordinator 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829final class AppCoordinator: Coordinator { private let window: UIWindow private func startLogin() { let navigationController = UINavigationController() let loginCoordinator = LoginCoordinator(navigationController: navigationController) loginCoordinator.delegate = self add(child: loginCoordinator) window.rootViewController = navigationController loginCoordinator.start() }}final class LoginCoordinator: Coordinator { private let navigationController: UINavigationController init(navigationController: UINavigationController) { self.navigationController = navigationController } func start() { let loginController = LoginController(dependencyContainer: dependencyContainer) loginController.delegate = self navigationController.viewControllers = [loginController] }} FlowController LoginFlowController leverages container view controller so it fits nicely with the way UIKit works. Here AppFlowController can just add LoginFlowController and LoginFlowController can just create its own embeddedNavigationController. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132final class AppFlowController: UIViewController { private func startLogin() { let loginFlowController = LoginFlowController( dependencyContainer: dependencyContainer ) loginFlowController.delegate = self add(childController: loginFlowController) loginFlowController.start() }}final class LoginFlowController: UIViewController { private let dependencyContainer: DependencyContainer private var embeddedNavigationController: UINavigationController! weak var delegate: LoginFlowControllerDelegate? init(dependencyContainer: DependencyContainer) { self.dependencyContainer = dependencyContainer super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil) embeddedNavigationController = UINavigationController() add(childController: embeddedNavigationController) } func start() { let loginController = LoginController(dependencyContainer: dependencyContainer) loginController.delegate = self embeddedNavigationController.viewControllers = [loginController] }} 7. FlowController and responder chainCoordinator Sometimes we want a quick way to bubble up message to parent Coordinator, one way to do that is to replicate UIResponder chain using associated object and protocol extensions, like Inter-connect with Coordinator 12345678910111213141516171819202122extension UIViewController { private struct AssociatedKeys { static var ParentCoordinator = \"ParentCoordinator\" } public var parentCoordinator: Any? { get { return objc_getAssociatedObject(self, &amp;AssociatedKeys.ParentCoordinator) } set { objc_setAssociatedObject(self, &amp;AssociatedKeys.ParentCoordinator, newValue, .OBJC_ASSOCIATION_ASSIGN) } }}open class Coordinator&lt;T: UIViewController&gt;: UIResponder, Coordinating { open var parent: Coordinating? override open var coordinatingResponder: UIResponder? { return parent as? UIResponder }} FlowController Since FlowController is UIViewController, which inherits from UIResponder, responder chain happens out of the box Responder objects‚Äîthat is, instances of UIResponder‚Äîconstitute the event-handling backbone of a UIKit app. Many key objects are also responders, including the UIApplication object, UIViewController objects, and all UIView objects (which includes UIWindow). As events occur, UIKit dispatches them to your app‚Äôs responder objects for handling. 8. FlowController and trait collectionFlowController I very much like how Kickstarter uses trait collection in testing. Well, since FlowController is a parent view controller, we can just override its trait collection, and that will affect the size classes of all view controllers inside that flow. As in A Better MVC, Part 2: Fixing Encapsulation The huge advantage of this approach is that system features come free. Trait collection propagation is free. View lifecycle callbacks are free. Safe area layout margins are generally free. The responder chain and preferred UI state callbacks are free. And future additions to UIViewController are also free. From setOverrideTraitCollection When implementing a custom container view controller, you can use this method to change the traits of any embedded child view controllers to something more appropriate for your layout. Making such a change alters other view controller behaviors associated with that child 1234567let trait = UITraitCollection(traitsFrom: [ .init(horizontalSizeClass: .compact), .init(verticalSizeClass: .regular), .init(userInterfaceIdiom: .phone)])appFlowController.setOverrideTraitCollection(trait, forChildViewController: loginFlowController) 9. FlowController and back buttonCoordinator One problem with UINavigationController is that clicking on the default back button pops the view controller out of the navigation stack, so Coordinator is not aware of that. With Coordinator you needs to keep Coordinator and UIViewController in sync, add try to hook up UINavigationControllerDelegate in order to clean up. Like in Back Buttons and Coordinators 1234567891011121314151617extension Coordinator: UINavigationControllerDelegate { func navigationController(navigationController: UINavigationController, didShowViewController viewController: UIViewController, animated: Bool) { // ensure the view controller is popping guard let fromViewController = navigationController.transitionCoordinator?.viewController(forKey: .from), !navigationController.viewControllers.contains(fromViewController) else { return } // and it's the right type if fromViewController is FirstViewControllerInCoordinator) { //deallocate the relevant coordinator } }} Or creating a class called NavigationController that inside manages a list of child coordinators. Like in Navigation coordinators 12345678910111213141516171819202122final class NavigationController: UIViewController { // MARK: - Inputs private let rootViewController: UIViewController // MARK: - Mutable state private var viewControllersToChildCoordinators: [UIViewController: Coordinator] = [:] // MARK: - Lazy views private lazy var childNavigationController: UINavigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: self.rootViewController) // MARK: - Initialization init(rootViewController: UIViewController) { self.rootViewController = rootViewController super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil) }} FlowController Since FlowController is just plain UIViewController, you don‚Äôt need to manually manage child FlowController. The child FlowController is gone when you pop or dismiss. If we want to listen to UINavigationController events, we can just handle that inside the FlowController 1234567891011121314151617181920final class LoginFlowController: UIViewController { private let dependencyContainer: DependencyContainer private var embeddedNavigationController: UINavigationController! weak var delegate: LoginFlowControllerDelegate? init(dependencyContainer: DependencyContainer) { self.dependencyContainer = dependencyContainer super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil) embeddedNavigationController = UINavigationController() embeddedNavigationController.delegate = self add(childController: embeddedNavigationController) }}extension LoginFlowController: UINavigationControllerDelegate { func navigationController(_ navigationController: UINavigationController, willShow viewController: UIViewController, animated: Bool) { }} 10. FlowController and callbackWe can use delegate pattern to notify FlowController to show another view controller in the flow 123456789101112extension ProductFlowController: ProductListControllerDelegate { func productListController(_ controller: ProductListController, didSelect product: Product) { let productDetailController = ProductDetailController( productNetworkingService: dependencyContainer.productNetworkingService, productEditService: dependencyContainer.productEditService, imageDownloaderService: dependencyContainer.imageDownloaderService ) productDetailController.delegate = self embeddedNavigationController.pushViewController(productDetailController, animated: true) }} Another approach is to use closure as callback, as proposed by @merowing_, and also in his post Improve your iOS Architecture with FlowControllers Using closures as triggers rather than delegate allows for more readable and specialized implementation, and multiple contexts 12345678910111213final class ProductFlowController { func start() { let productListController = ProductListController( productNetworkingService: dependencyContainer.productNetworkingService ) productListController.didSelectProduct = { [weak self] product in self?.showDetail(for: product) } embeddedNavigationController.viewControllers = [productListController] }} 11.

And for each app that we build, there are times we need to reuse the same code, build and tweak it a bit to make it work for different environments. For example, we might need multiple skins, themes, a free and paid version, or more often different staging and production environments. And the task that we can‚Äôt avoid is adding app icons and splash screens to our apps. In fact, to add a staging and production environment, and to add app icons, requires us to use Xcode and Android Studio, and we do it the same way we do with native iOS or Android projects. Let‚Äôs call our app MyApp and bootstrap it with react-native init MyApp . There will of course, be tons of libraries to help us with managing different environments. In this post, we will do just like we did with native apps, so that we know the basic steps. Build configuration, target, build types, production flavor, and build variantThere are some terminologies we needed to remember. In iOS, debug and releases are called build configurations, and staging and production are called targets. A build configuration specifies a set of build settings used to build a target‚Äôs product in a particular way. For example, it is common to have separate build configurations for debug and release builds of a product.A target specifies a product to build and contains the instructions for building the product from a set of files in a project or work-space. A target defines a single product; it organizes the inputs into the build system ‚Äî the source files and instructions for processing those source files ‚Äî required to build that product. Projects can contain one or more targets, each of which produces one product In Android, debug and releases are called build types, and staging and production are called product flavors. Together they form build variants. For example, a ‚Äúdemo‚Äù product flavor can specify different features and device requirements, such as custom source code, resources, and minimum API levels, while the ‚Äúdebug‚Äù build type applies different build and packaging settings, such as debug options and signing keys. The resulting build variant is the ‚ÄúdemoDebug‚Äù version of your app, and it includes a combination of the configurations and resources included in the ‚Äúdemo‚Äù product flavor, ‚Äúdebug‚Äù build type, and main/ source set. Staging and production targets in iOSOpen MyApp.xcodeproj inside ios using Xcode. Here is what we get after bootstrapping: React Native creates iOS and tvOS apps, and two test targets. In Xcode, a project can contain many targets, and each target means a unique product with its own build settings ‚Äî Info.plist and app icons. Duplicate targetIf we don‚Äôt need the tvOS app, we can delete the MyApp-tvOS and MyApp-tvOSTests . Let‚Äôs use MyApp target as our production environment, and right click -&gt; Duplicate to make another target. Let‚Äôs call it MyApp Staging. Each target must have unique bundle id. Change the bundle id of MyApp to com.onmyway133.MyApp and MyApp Staging to com.onmyway133.MyApp.Staging. Info.plistWhen we duplicate MyApp target , Xcode also duplicates Info.plist into MyApp copy-Info.plist for the staging target. Change it to a more meaningful name Info-Staging.plist and drag it to the MyApp group in Xcode to stay organised. After dragging, MyApp Staging target can‚Äôt find the plist, so click Choose Info.plist File and point to the Info-Staging.plist. SchemeXcode also duplicates the scheme when we duplicate the target, so we get MyApp copy: Click Manage Schemes in the scheme drop-down to open Scheme manager: I usually delete the generated MyApp copy scheme, then I create a new scheme again for the MyApp Staging target. You need to make sure that the scheme is marked as Shared so that it is tracked into git. For some reason, the staging scheme does not have all the things set up like the production scheme. You can run into issues like ‚ÄòReact/RCTBundleURLProvider.h‚Äô file not found or RN: ‚ÄòReact/RCTBridgeModule.h‚Äô file not found . It is because React target is not linked yet. To solve it, we must disable Parallelise Build and add React target and move it above MyApp Staging. Staging and production product flavors in AndroidOpen the android folder in Android Studio. By default there are only debug and release build types: They are configured in the app module build.gradle: buildTypes { release { minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(&quot;proguard-android.txt&quot;), &quot;proguard-rules.pro&quot; } }First, let‚Äôs change application id to com.onmyway133.MyApp to match iOS. It is not required but I think it‚Äôs good to stay organised. Then create two product flavors for staging and production. For staging, let‚Äôs add .Staging to the application id. From Android Studio 3, ‚Äúall flavors must now belong to a named flavor dimension‚Äù ‚Äî normally we just need default dimensions. Here is how it looks in build.gradle for our app module: android { compileSdkVersion rootProject.ext.compileSdkVersion buildToolsVersion rootProject.ext.buildToolsVersion flavorDimensions &quot;default&quot; defaultConfig { applicationId &quot;com.onmyway133.MyApp&quot; minSdkVersion rootProject.ext.minSdkVersion targetSdkVersion rootProject.ext.targetSdkVersion versionCode 1 versionName &quot;1.0&quot; ndk { abiFilters &quot;armeabi-v7a&quot;, &quot;x86&quot; } } splits { abi { reset() enable enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture universalApk false // If true, also generate a universal APK include &quot;armeabi-v7a&quot;, &quot;x86&quot; } } buildTypes { release { minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(&quot;proguard-android.txt&quot;), &quot;proguard-rules.pro&quot; } } productFlavors { staging { applicationIdSuffix &quot;.Staging&quot; } production { } } }Click Sync Now to let gradle do the syncing job. After that, we can see that we have four build variants: How to run staging and productionTo run the Android app, we can specify a variant like react-native run-android ‚Äî variant=productionDebug, but I prefer to go to Android Studio, select the variant, and run. To run iOS app, we can specify the scheme like react-native run-ios ‚Äî simulator=‚ÄôiPhone X‚Äô ‚Äî scheme=‚ÄùMyApp Staging‚Äù . As of react-native 0.57.0 this does not work. But it does not matter as I usually go to Xcode, select the scheme, and run. Add app icon for iOSAccording to the Human Interface Guideline, we need app icons of different sizes for different iOS versions, device resolutions, and situations (notification, settings, Spring Board). I‚Äôve crafted a tool called IconGenerator, which was previously mentioned in Best Open Source Tools For Developers. Drag the icon that you want ‚Äî I prefer those with 1024x1024 pixels for high resolution app icons ‚Äî to the Icon Generator MacOS app. Click Generate and we get AppIcon.appiconset . This contains app icons of the required sizes that are ready to be used in Asset Catalog. Drag this to Asset Catalog in Xcode. That is for production. For staging, it‚Äôs good practice to add a ‚ÄúStaging‚Äù banner so that testers know which is staging, and which is production. We can easily do this in Sketch. Remember to set a background, so we don‚Äôt get a transparent background. For an app icon with transparent background, iOS shows the background as black which looks horrible. After exporting the image, drag the staging icon to the IconGenerator the same way we did earlier. But this time, rename the generated appiconset to AppIcon-Staging.appiconset. Then drag this to Asset Catalog in Xcode. For the staging target to use staging app icons, open MyApp Staging target and choose AppIcon-Staging as App Icon Source. Add app icon for Android I like to switch to Project view, as it is easier to change app icons. Click res -&gt; New -&gt; Image Asset to open Asset Studio. We can use the same app icons that we used in iOS: Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduced Adaptive Icons so we need to tweak the Resize slider to make sure our app icons look as nice as possible. Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduces adaptive launcher icons, which can display a variety of shapes across different device models. For example, an adaptive launcher icon can display a circular shape on one OEM device, and display a squircle on another device. Each device OEM provides a mask, which the system then uses to render all adaptive icons with the same shape. Adaptive launcher icons are also used in shortcuts, the Settings app, sharing dialogs, and the overview screen. ‚Äî Android developers We are doing for production first, which means the main Res Directory. This step will replace the existing placeholder app icons generated by Android Studio when we bootstrapped React Native projects. Now that we have production app icons, let‚Äôs make staging app icons. Android manages code and assets via convention. Click on src -&gt; New -&gt; Directory and create a staging folder. Inside staging, create a folder called res . Anything we place in staging will replace the ones in main ‚Äî this is called source sets. You can read more here: Build with source sets. You can use source set directories to contain the code and resources you want packaged only with certain configurations. For example, if you are building the ‚ÄúdemoDebug‚Äù build variant, which is the crossproduct of a ‚Äúdemo‚Äù product flavor and ‚Äúdebug‚Äù build type, Gradle looks at these directories, and gives them the following priority:src/demoDebug/ (build variant source set)src/debug/ (build type source set)src/demo/ (product flavor source set)src/main/ (main source set) Right click on staging/res -&gt; New -&gt; Image Asset to make app icons for staging. We also use the same staging app icons like in iOS, but this time we choose staging as Res Directory. This way Android Studio knows how to generate different ic_launcher and put them into staging. Add launch screen for iOSThe splash screen is called a [Launch Screen](http://Launch Screen) in iOS, and it is important. A launch screen appears instantly when your app starts up. The launch screen is quickly replaced with the first screen of your app, giving the impression that your app is fast and responsive In the old days, we needed to use static launch images with different sizes for each device and orientation. Launch Screen storyboardFor now the recommended way is to use Launch Screen storyboard . The iOS project from React Native comes with LaunchScreen.xib but xib is a thing of the past. Let‚Äôs delete it and create a file called Launch Screen.storyboard . Right click on MyApp folder -&gt; New and chose Launch Screen, add it to both targets as usually we show the same splash screen for both staging and production. Image SetOpen asset catalog, right click and select New Image Set . We can name it anything. This will be used in the Launch Screen.storyboard. Open Launch Screen.storyboard and add an UIImageView . If you are using Xcode 10, click the Library button in the upper right corner and choose Show Objects Library. Set image for Image View, and make sure Content Mode is set to Aspect Filled, as this ensures that the image always covers the full screen (although it may be cropped). Then connect ImageView using constraints to the View, not the Safe Area. You do this by Control+drag from the Image View (splash) to the View. Constrains without marginClick into each constraint and uncheck Relative to Margin. This makes our ImageView pin to the very edges of the view and with no margin at all. Now go to both targets and select Launch Screen.storyboard as Launch Screen File: On iOS, the launch screen is often cached, so you probably won‚Äôt see the changes. One way to avoid that is to delete the app and run it again. Add a launcher theme for AndroidThere are several ways to add splash screen for Android, from using launcher themes, Splash Activity, and a timer. For me, a reasonable splash screen for Android should be a very minimal image. As there are many Android devices with different ratios and resolutions, if you want to show a full screen splash image, it will probably not scale correctly for each device. This is just about UX. For the splash screen, let‚Äôs use the launcher theme with splash_background.xml . Learn about Device MetricThere is no single splash image that suits all Android devices. A more logical approach is to create multiple splash images for all common resolutions in portrait and landscape. Or we can design a minimal splash image that works. You can find more info here: Device Metric. Here is how to add splash screen in 4 easy steps: Add splash imageWe usually need a common splash screen for both staging and production. Drag an image into main/res/drawble . Android Studio seems to have a problem with recognising some jpg images for the splash screen, so it‚Äôs best to choose png images. Add splash_background.xmlRight click on drawable -&gt; New -&gt; Drawable resource file . Name it whatever you want ‚Äî I choose splash_background.xml . Choose the root element as layer-list: A [Layer List](http://Layer List) means ‚Äúa Drawable that manages an array of other Drawables. These are drawn in array order, so the element with the largest index is drawn on top‚Äù. Here is how splash_background.xml looks like: &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt; &lt;!-- The android:opacity=‚Äùopaque‚Äù line ‚Äî this is critical in preventing a flash of black as your theme transitions. --&gt; &lt;layer-list xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot; android:opacity=&quot;opaque&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- The background color, preferably the same as your normal theme --&gt; &lt;item android:drawable=&quot;@android:color/white&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- Your splash image --&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;bitmap android:src=&quot;@drawable/iron_man&quot; android:gravity=&quot;center&quot;/&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/layer-list&gt;Note that we point to our splash image we added earlier with android:src=‚Äù@drawable/iron_man‚Äù. Declare styleOpen styles.xml and add SplashTheme: &lt;style name=&quot;SplashTheme&quot; parent=&quot;Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar&quot;&gt; &lt;item name=&quot;android:windowBackground&quot;&gt;@drawable/splash_background&lt;/item&gt; &lt;/style&gt;Use SplashThemeGo to Manifest.xml and change the theme of the the launcher activity, which has category android:name=‚Äùandroid.intent.category.LAUNCHER‚Äù . Change it to android:theme=‚Äù@style/SplashTheme‚Äù . For React Native, the launcher activity is usually MainActivity . Here is how Manifest.xml looks: &lt;manifest xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot; package=&quot;com.myapp&quot;&gt; &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.INTERNET&quot; /&gt; &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW&quot;/&gt; &lt;application android:name=&quot;.MainApplication&quot; android:label=&quot;@string/app_name&quot; android:icon=&quot;@mipmap/ic_launcher&quot; android:allowBackup=&quot;false&quot; android:theme=&quot;@style/AppTheme&quot;&gt; &lt;activity android:name=&quot;.MainActivity&quot; android:label=&quot;@string/app_name&quot; android:configChanges=&quot;keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize&quot; android:theme=&quot;@style/SplashTheme&quot; android:windowSoftInputMode=&quot;adjustResize&quot;&gt; &lt;intent-filter&gt; &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.MAIN&quot; /&gt; &lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.LAUNCHER&quot; /&gt; &lt;/intent-filter&gt; &lt;/activity&gt; &lt;activity android:name=&quot;com.facebook.react.devsupport.DevSettingsActivity&quot; /&gt; &lt;/application&gt; &lt;/manifest&gt;Run the app now and you should see the splash screen showing when the app starts. Managing environment configurationsThe differences between staging and production are just about app names, application ids, and app icons. We probably use different API keys, and backend URL for staging and production. Right now the most popular library to handle these scenarios is react-native-config, which is said to ‚Äúbring some 12 factor love to your mobile apps‚Äù. It requires lots of steps to get started, and I hope there is a less verbose solution. Where to go from hereIn this post, we touched Xcode and Android Studio more than Visual Studio Code, but this was inevitable. I hope this post was useful to you.

It works by providing a common interface that talks to native iOS and Android components. There are enough essentials components to get started, but the cooler thing is that it is easy to build our own, hence we are not limited by React Native. In this post we will implement a linear gradient view, which is not supported by default in React Native, using native UI component, particularly CAGradientLayer in iOS and GradientDrawable in Android. In Javascript there are hundreds of libraries for a single problem and you should check if you really need it or not. A search on Google for linear gradient shows a bunch of libraries, like react-native-linear-gradient. The less dependencies the better. Linear gradient is in fact very easy to build and we probably don‚Äôt need to add extra dependencies. Also integrating and following updates with 3rd libraries are painful, I would avoid that as much as possible. Native UI component vs Native moduleIn React Native, there are native UI component and native module. React Native moves pretty fast so most of the articles will be outdated, it‚Äôs best to consult official documentation for the latest React Native version. This post will try to give you overview of the whole picture because for now the official guide seems not completed. Native Modules in iOS Native Modules in Android Native UI Components in iOS Native UI Components in Android In simple explanation, native UI component is about making UIView in iOS or View in Android available as React.Component and used in render function in Javascript. There are tons of native UI widgets out there ready to be used in the latest apps ‚Äî some of them are part of the platform, others are available as third-party libraries, and still more might be in use in your very own portfolio. React Native has several of the most critical platform components already wrapped, like ScrollView and TextInput, but not all of them, and certainly not ones you might have written yourself for a previous app. Native module is more general in that we make any native class available in Javascript. Sometimes an app needs access to platform API, and React Native doesn‚Äôt have a corresponding module yet. Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift or C++ code without having to reimplement it in JavaScript, or write some high performance, multi-threaded code such as for image processing, a database, or any number of advanced extensions. View ManagerTo expose native UI views, we use the ViewManager as the bridge, it is RCTViewManager in iOS and SimpleViewManager in Android. Then inside this ViewManager we can just return our custom view. I see it‚Äôs good to use Objective C/Java for the ViewManager to match React Native classes, and the custom view we can use either Swift/Objective C in iOS and Kotlin/Java in Android. I prefer to use Swift, but in this post to remove the overhead of introducing bridging header from Swift to Objective C, we use Objective C for simplicity. We also add the native source code directly into iOS and Android project, but in the future we can extract them easily to a React Native library. For now let ‚Äòs use the name RNGradientViewManager and RNGradientView to stay consistent between iOS and Android. The RN prefix is arbitrary, you can use any prefix you want, but here I use it to indicate that these classes are meant to be used in Javascript side in React Native. Implement in iOSProject structureAdd these Objective-C classes to the projects, I usually place them inside NativeComponents folder Native views are created and manipulated by subclasses of RCTViewManager. These subclasses are similar in function to view controllers, but are essentially singletons - only one instance of each is created by the bridge. They expose native views to the RCTUIManager, which delegates back to them to set and update the properties of the views as necessary. The RCTViewManagers are also typically the delegates for the views, sending events back to JavaScript via the bridge. RNGradientViewManagerCreate a RNGradientViewManager that inherits from RCTViewManager RNGradientViewManager.h #import &lt;React/RCTViewManager.h&gt; @interface RNGradientViewManager : RCTViewManager @endRNGradientViewManager.m #import &quot;RNGradientViewManager.h&quot; #import &quot;RNGradientView.h&quot; [@implementation](http://twitter.com/implementation) RNGradientViewManager RCT_EXPORT_MODULE() - (UIView *)view { return [[RNGradientView alloc] init]; } RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(progress, NSNumber); RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(cornerRadius, NSNumber); RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(fromColor, UIColor); RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(toColor, UIColor); [@end](http://twitter.com/end)In iOS we use macro RCT_EXPORT_MODULE() to automatically register the module with the bridge when it loads. The optional js_name argument will be used as the JS module name. If omitted, the JS module name will match the Objective-C class name. #define RCT_EXPORT_MODULE(js_name)The ViewManager, not the View, is the facade to the Javascript side, so we expose properties using RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY . Note that we do that inside @implementation RNGradientViewManager Here we specify the types as NSNumber and UIColor , and later in Javascript we can just pass number and color hex string, and React Native can do the conversions for us. In older versions of React Native, we need processColor in Javascript or RCTConvert color in iOS side, but we don‚Äôt need to perform manual conversion now. RNGradientViewIn the Native UI component example for iOS, they use WKWebView but here we make a RNGradientView which subclasses from RCTView to take advantage of many features of React Native views, and to avoid some problems we can get if using a normal UIView RNGradientView.h #import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt; #import &lt;React/RCTView.h&gt; [@interface](http://twitter.com/interface) RNGradientView : RCTView [@end](http://twitter.com/end)RNGradientView.m #import &quot;RNGradientView.h&quot; #import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt; [@interface](http://twitter.com/interface) RNGradientView() [@property](http://twitter.com/property) CAGradientLayer *gradientLayer; [@property](http://twitter.com/property) UIColor *_fromColor; [@property](http://twitter.com/property) UIColor *_toColor; [@property](http://twitter.com/property) NSNumber *_progress; [@property](http://twitter.com/property) NSNumber *_cornerRadius; [@end](http://twitter.com/end) [@implementation](http://twitter.com/implementation) RNGradientView // MARK: - Init - (instancetype)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame { self = [super initWithFrame:frame]; if (self) { self.gradientLayer = [self makeGradientLayer]; [self.layer addSublayer:self.gradientLayer]; self._fromColor = [UIColor blackColor]; self._toColor = [UIColor whiteColor]; self._progress = [@0](http://twitter.com/0).5; [self update]; } return self; } // MARK: - Life cycle - (void)layoutSubviews { [super layoutSubviews]; self.gradientLayer.frame = CGRectMake( 0, 0, self.bounds.size.width*self._progress.floatValue, self.bounds.size.height ); } // MARK: - Properties - (void)setFromColor:(UIColor *)color { self._fromColor = color; [self update]; } - (void)setToColor:(UIColor *)color { self._toColor = color; [self update]; } - (void)setProgress:(NSNumber *)progress { self._progress = progress; [self update]; } - (void)setCornerRadius:(NSNumber *)cornerRadius { self._cornerRadius = cornerRadius; [self update]; } // MARK: - Helper - (void)update { self.gradientLayer.colors = @[ (id)self._fromColor.CGColor, (id)self._toColor.CGColor ]; self.gradientLayer.cornerRadius = self._cornerRadius.floatValue; [self setNeedsLayout]; } - (CAGradientLayer *)makeGradientLayer { CAGradientLayer *gradientLayer = [CAGradientLayer layer]; gradientLayer.masksToBounds = true; gradientLayer.startPoint = CGPointMake(0.0, 0.5); gradientLayer.endPoint = CGPointMake(1.0, 0.5); gradientLayer.anchorPoint = CGPointZero; return gradientLayer; } [@end](http://twitter.com/end)We can implement anything we want in this native view, in this case we use CAGradientLayer to get nicely displayed linear gradient. Since RNGradientViewManager exposes some properties like progress, cornerRadius, fromColor, toColor we need to implement some setters as they will be called by React Native when we update values in Javascript side. In the setter we call setNeedsLayout to tell the view to invalidate the layout, hence layoutSubviews will be called again. requireNativeComponentOpen project in Visual Studio Code, add GradientView.js to src/nativeComponents . The folder name is arbitrary, but it‚Äôs good to stay organised. import { requireNativeComponent } from &apos;react-native&apos; module.exports = requireNativeComponent(&apos;RNGradientView&apos;, null)Here we use requireNativeComponent to load our RNGradientView . We only need this one Javascript file for interacting with both iOS and Android. You can name the module as RNGradientView but I think the practice in Javascript is that we don‚Äôt use prefix, so we name just GradientView . const requireNativeComponent = (uiViewClassName: string): string =&gt; createReactNativeComponentClass(uiViewClassName, () =&gt; getNativeComponentAttributes(uiViewClassName), ); module.exports = requireNativeComponent;Before I tried to use export default for the native component, but this way the view is not rendered at all, even if I wrap it inside React.Component . It seems we must use module.exports for the native component to be properly loaded. Now using it is as easy as declare the GradientView with JSX syntax import GradientView from &apos;nativeComponents/GradientView&apos; export default class Profile extends React.Component { render() { return ( &lt;SafeAreaView style={styles.container}&gt; &lt;GradientView style={styles.progress} fromColor={R.colors.progress.from} toColor={R.colors.progress.to} cornerRadius={5.0} progress={0.8} /&gt; ) } }Implement in AndroidProject structureAdd these Java classes to the projects, I usually place them inside nativeComponents folder RNGradientManagerCreate a RNGradientManager that extends SimpleViewManagerRNGradientManager.java package com.onmyway133.myApp.nativeComponents; import android.support.annotation.Nullable; import com.facebook.react.uimanager.SimpleViewManager; import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ThemedReactContext; import com.facebook.react.uimanager.annotations.ReactProp; public class RNGradientViewManager extends SimpleViewManager&lt;RNGradientView&gt; { [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) public String getName() { return &quot;RNGradientView&quot;; } [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) protected RNGradientView createViewInstance(ThemedReactContext reactContext) { return new RNGradientView(reactContext); } // Properties [@ReactProp](http://twitter.com/ReactProp)(name = &quot;progress&quot;) public void setProgress(RNGradientView view, [@Nullable](http://twitter.com/Nullable) float progress) { view.setProgress(progress); } [@ReactProp](http://twitter.com/ReactProp)(name = &quot;cornerRadius&quot;) public void setCornerRadius(RNGradientView view, [@Nullable](http://twitter.com/Nullable) float cornerRadius) { view.setCornerRadius(cornerRadius); } [@ReactProp](http://twitter.com/ReactProp)(name = &quot;fromColor&quot;, customType = &quot;Color&quot;) public void setFromColor(RNGradientView view, [@Nullable](http://twitter.com/Nullable) int color) { view.setFromColor(color); } [@ReactProp](http://twitter.com/ReactProp)(name = &quot;toColor&quot;, customType = &quot;Color&quot;) public void setToColor(RNGradientView view, [@Nullable](http://twitter.com/Nullable) int color) { view.setToColor(color); } }We usually use Color as android.graphics.Color , but for the GradientDrawable that we are going to use, it use color as ARGB integer. So it‚Äôs nifty that React Native deals with Color as int type. We also need to specify customType = ‚ÄúColor‚Äù as Color is something kinda custom. RNGradientViewThis is where we implement our view, we can do that in Kotlin if we like. RNGradientView.java package com.onmyway133.myApp.nativeComponents; import android.content.Context; import android.graphics.drawable.GradientDrawable; import android.graphics.drawable.ScaleDrawable; import android.support.annotation.Nullable; import android.util.AttributeSet; import android.view.Gravity; import android.view.View; public class RNGradientView extends View { float progress; float cornerRadius; int fromColor; int toColor; public RNGradientView(Context context) { super(context); } public RNGradientView(Context context, @Nullable AttributeSet attrs) { super(context, attrs); } public RNGradientView(Context context, @Nullable AttributeSet attrs, int defStyleAttr) { super(context, attrs, defStyleAttr); } public RNGradientView(Context context, @Nullable AttributeSet attrs, int defStyleAttr, int defStyleRes) { super(context, attrs, defStyleAttr, defStyleRes); } // update void update() { GradientDrawable gradient = new GradientDrawable(); gradient.setColors(new int[] { this.fromColor, this.toColor }); gradient.setOrientation(GradientDrawable.Orientation.*LEFT_RIGHT*); gradient.setGradientType(GradientDrawable.*LINEAR_GRADIENT*); gradient.setShape(GradientDrawable.*RECTANGLE*); gradient.setCornerRadius(this.cornerRadius * 4); ScaleDrawable scale = new ScaleDrawable(gradient, Gravity.*LEFT*, 1, -1); scale.setLevel((int)(this.progress * 10000)); this.setBackground(scale); } // Getter &amp; setter public void setProgress(float progress) { this.progress = progress; this.update(); } public void setCornerRadius(float cornerRadius) { this.cornerRadius = cornerRadius; this.update(); } public void setFromColor(int fromColor) { this.fromColor = fromColor; this.update(); } public void setToColor(int toColor) { this.toColor = toColor; this.update(); } }Pay attention to the setColors as it use an array of int Sets the colors used to draw the gradient.Each color is specified as an ARGB integer and the array must contain at least 2 colors. If we call setBackground with the GradientDrawable it will be stretched to fill the view. In our case we want to support progress which determines how long the gradient should show. To fix that we use ScaleDrawable which is a Drawable that changes the size of another Drawable based on its current level value. The same value for cornerRadius works in iOS, but for Android we need to use higher values, that‚Äôs why the multiplication in gradient.setCornerRadius(this.cornerRadius * 4) Shape drawableAnother way to implement gradient is to use Shape Drawable with xml , it‚Äôs the equivalent of using xib in iOS. We can create something like gradient.xml and put that inside /res/drawable &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt; &lt;shape xmlns:android=&quot;[http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android](http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android)&quot; android:shape=&quot;rectangle&quot;&gt; &lt;gradient android:startColor=&quot;#3B5998&quot; android:endColor=&quot;#00000000&quot; android:angle=&quot;45&quot;/&gt; &lt;/shape&gt;For more information, you can readAndroid Shape Drawables TutorialHave you ever wanted to reduce your Android application‚Äôs size or make it look more interesting? If yes, then you‚Ä¶android.jlelse.eu We can also use the class directly ShapeDrawable in code A Drawable object that draws primitive shapes. A ShapeDrawable takes a Shape object and manages its presence on the screen. If no Shape is given, then the ShapeDrawable will default to a RectShape.This object can be defined in an XML file with the element. GradientManagerPackageIn iOS we use RCT_EXPORT_MODULE to register the component, but in Android, things are done explicitly using Package . A package can register both native module and native UI component. In this case we deal with just UI component, so let‚Äôs return RNGradientManager in createViewManagers GradientManagerPackage.java package com.onmyway133.myApp.nativeComponents; import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage; import com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule; import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext; import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ViewManager; import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.Collections; import java.util.List; public class RNGradientViewPackage implements ReactPackage { [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) public List&lt;NativeModule&gt; createNativeModules(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) { return Collections.emptyList(); } [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) public List&lt;ViewManager&gt; createViewManagers(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) { return Arrays.&lt;ViewManager&gt;asList( new RNGradientViewManager() ); } }Then head over to MainApplication.java to declare our package [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) protected List&lt;ReactPackage&gt; getPackages() { return Arrays.&lt;ReactPackage&gt;asList( new MainReactPackage(), new RNGradientViewPackage() ); }That‚Äôs it for Android. We already have the GradientView.js written earlier, when running the app in Android, it will look up and load our RNGradientView Where to go from hereHope you learn something about native UI component. In the post we only touch the surfaces on what native UI component can do, which is just passing configurations from Javascript to native. There are a lot more to discover, like event handling, thread, styles, custom types, please consult the official documentation for correct guidance.

It is a cross-platform layout engine which implements Flexbox so we use the same layout code for both platforms. As someone who uses Auto Layout in iOS and Constraint Layout in Android, I find Flexbox bit hard to use at first, but there are many tasks that Flexbox does very well, they are distribute elements in space and flow layout. In this post we will use Flexbox to build a tag selection view using just Javascript code. This is very easy to do so we don‚Äôt need to install extra dependencies. Our tag view will support both multiple selection and exclusive selection. First, we need a custom Button . Button with BackgroundButton is of the basic elements in React Native, but it is somewhat limited if we want to have custom content inside the button, for example texts, images and background import { Button } from &apos;react-native&apos; ... &lt;Button onPress={onPressLearnMore} title=&quot;Learn More&quot; color=&quot;#841584&quot; accessibilityLabel=&quot;Learn more about this purple button&quot; /&gt;TouchableOpacityLuckily we have TouchableOpacity, which is a wrapper for making views respond properly to touches. On press down, the opacity of the wrapped view is decreased, dimming it. To implement button in our tag view, we need to a button with background a check image. Create a file called BackgroundButton.js import React from &apos;react&apos; import { TouchableOpacity, View, Text, StyleSheet, Image } from &apos;react-native&apos; import R from &apos;res/R&apos; export default class BackgroundButton extends React.Component { render() { const styles = this.makeStyles() return ( &lt;TouchableOpacity style={styles.touchable} onPress={this.props.onPress}&gt; &lt;View style={styles.view}&gt; {this.makeImageIfAny(styles)} &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;{this.props.title}&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;/View&gt; &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt; ) } makeImageIfAny(styles) { if (this.props.showImage) { return &lt;Image style={styles.image} source={R.images.check} /&gt; } } makeStyles() { return StyleSheet.create({ view: { flexDirection: &apos;row&apos;, borderRadius: 23, borderColor: this.props.borderColor, borderWidth: 2, backgroundColor: this.props.backgroundColor, height: 46, alignItems: &apos;center&apos;, justifyContent: &apos;center&apos;, paddingLeft: 16, paddingRight: 16 }, touchable: { marginLeft: 4, marginRight: 4, marginBottom: 8 }, image: { marginRight: 8 }, text: { fontSize: 18, textAlign: &apos;center&apos;, color: this.props.textColor, fontSize: 16 } }) } }Dynamic stylesNormally we use const styles = StyleSheet.create({}) but since we want our button to be configurable, we make styles into a function, so on every render we get a new styles with proper configurations. The properties we support are borderColor, textColor, backgroundColor and showImage In the makeImageIfAny we only need to return Image if the view is selected. We don‚Äôt have the else case, so in if showImage is false, this returns undefined and React won‚Äôt render any element makeImageIfAny(styles) { if (this.props.showImage) { return &lt;Image style={styles.image} source={R.images.check} /&gt; } }padding and marginTo understand padding and margin, visit CSS Box Model. Basically padding means clearing an area around the content and padding is transparent, while margin means clearing an area outside the border and the margin also is transparent. Pay attention to styles . We have margin for touchable so that each tag button have a little margin outside each other. touchable: { marginLeft: 4, marginRight: 4, marginBottom: 8 }In the view we need flexDirection as row because React Native has flexDirection as column by default. And a row means we have Image and Text side by side horizontally inside the button. We also use alignItems and justifyContent to align elements centeredly on both main and cross axises. The padding is used to have some spaces between the inner text and the view. view: { flexDirection: &apos;row&apos;, height: 46, alignItems: &apos;center&apos;, justifyContent: &apos;center&apos;, paddingLeft: 16, paddingRight: 16 }Tag ViewCreate a file called TagsView.js This is where we parse tags and show a bunch of BackgroundButton import React from &apos;react&apos; import { View, StyleSheet, Button } from &apos;react-native&apos; import R from &apos;res/R&apos; import BackgroundButton from &apos;library/components/BackgroundButton&apos; import addOrRemove from &apos;library/utils/addOrRemove&apos; export default class TagsView extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) this.state = { selected: props.selected } } render() { return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; {this.makeButtons()} &lt;/View&gt; ) } onPress = (tag) =&gt; { let selected if (this.props.isExclusive) { selected = [tag] } else { selected = addOrRemove(this.state.selected, tag) } this.setState({ selected }) } makeButtons() { return this.props.all.map((tag, i) =&gt; { const on = this.state.selected.includes(tag) const backgroundColor = on ? R.colors.on.backgroundColor : R.colors.off.backgroundColor const textColor = on ? R.colors.on.text : R.colors.off.text const borderColor = on ? R.colors.on.border : R.colors.off.border return ( &lt;BackgroundButton backgroundColor={backgroundColor} textColor={textColor} borderColor={borderColor} onPress={() =&gt; { this.onPress(tag) }} key={i} showImage={on} title={tag} /&gt; ) }) } } const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, flexDirection: &apos;row&apos;, flexWrap: &apos;wrap&apos;, padding: 20 } })We parse an array of tags to build BackgroundButton . We keep the selected array in state because this is mutated inside the TagsView component. If it is isExclusive then the new selected contains just the new selected tag. If it is multiple selection, then we add the new selected tag into the selected array. The addOrRemove is a our homegrown utility function to add an item into an array if it does not exists, or remove if it exists, using the high orderfilter function. const addOrRemove = (array, item) =&gt; { const exists = array.includes(item) if (exists) { return array.filter((c) =&gt; { return c !== item }) } else { const result = array result.push(item) return result } }Flex wrapPay attention to styles const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, flexDirection: &apos;row&apos;, flexWrap: &apos;wrap&apos;, padding: 20 } })The hero here is flexWrap which specifies whether the flexible items should wrap or not. Take a look at CSS flex-wrap property for other options. Since we have main axis as row , element will be wrapped to the next row if there are not enough space. That‚Äôs how we can achieve a beautiful tag view. Using TagsViewThen consuming TagsView is as easy as declare it inside render const selected = [&apos;Swift&apos;, Kotlin] const tags = [&apos;Swift&apos;, &apos;Kotlin&apos;, &apos;C#&apos;, &apos;Haskell&apos;, &apos;Java&apos;] return ( &lt;TagsView all={tags} selected={selected} isExclusive={false} /&gt; )Learning FlexboxLearning Flebox is crucial in using React and React Native effectively.

The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities As someone who worked with Auto Layout in iOS and Constrain Layout in Android, I sometimes find it difficult to work with Flexbox in React Native. One of them is how to position certain element at the top or the bottom of the screen. This is the scenario when one element does not follow the rule i the container. A traditional layoutConsider this traditional welcome screen, where we have some texts and a login button. Which is easily achieved with import React from &apos;react&apos; import { View, StyleSheet, Image, Text, Button } from &apos;react-native&apos; import strings from &apos;res/strings&apos; import palette from &apos;res/palette&apos; import images from &apos;res/images&apos; import ImageButton from &apos;library/components/ImageButton&apos; export default class Welcome extends React.Component { render() { return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; &lt;Image style={styles.image} source={images.placeholder} /&gt; &lt;Text style={styles.heading}&gt;{strings.onboarding.welcome.heading.toUpperCase()}&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;{strings.onboarding.welcome.text1}&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;{strings.onboarding.welcome.text2}&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;ImageButton style={styles.button} title={strings.onboarding.welcome.button} /&gt; &lt;/View&gt; ) } } const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, alignItems: &apos;center&apos; }, image: { marginTop: 50 }, heading: { ...palette.heading, ...{ marginTop: 40 } }, text: { ...palette.text, ...{ marginHorizontal: 8, marginVertical: 10 } } })Pay attention to styles . Unlike in web, Flexbox in React Native defaults main axis to be vertical, so elements are laid out from top to bottom. alignItems makes sure all elements are centered in the horizontal axis, which is the cross axis according to Flexbox terminology. Position button at the bottomAccording to design, the button should be positioned at the bottom of the screen. A dark though might suggest us to use position: ‚Äòabsolute‚Äô , something like button: { position: &apos;absolute&apos;, bottom:0 }It workaround could work, but it‚Äôs like opting out of Flexbox. We like Flexbox and we like to embrace it. The solution is to use add a container for the button, and use flex-end inside so that the button moves to the bottom. Let‚Äôs add a container &lt;View style={styles.bottom}&gt; &lt;ImageButton style={styles.button} title={strings.onboarding.welcome.button} /&gt; &lt;/View&gt;and styles bottom: { flex: 1, justifyContent: &apos;flex-end&apos;, marginBottom: 36 }The flex tells the bottom view to take the remaining space. And inside this space, the bottom is laid out from the bottom, that‚Äôs what the flex-end means. Here is how the result looks like And there is the full code import React from &apos;react&apos; import { View, StyleSheet, Image, Text, Button } from &apos;react-native&apos; import strings from &apos;res/strings&apos; import palette from &apos;res/palette&apos; import images from &apos;res/images&apos; import ImageButton from &apos;library/components/ImageButton&apos; export default class Welcome extends React.Component { render() { return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; &lt;Image style={styles.image} source={images.placeholder} /&gt; &lt;Text style={styles.heading}&gt;{strings.onboarding.welcome.heading.toUpperCase()}&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;{strings.onboarding.welcome.text1}&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;{strings.onboarding.welcome.text2}&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;View style={styles.bottom}&gt; &lt;ImageButton style={styles.button} title={strings.onboarding.welcome.button} /&gt; &lt;/View&gt; &lt;/View&gt; ) } } const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, alignItems: &apos;center&apos; }, image: { marginTop: 50 }, heading: { ...palette.heading, ...{ marginTop: 40 } }, text: { ...palette.text, ...{ marginHorizontal: 8, marginVertical: 10 } }, bottom: { flex: 1, justifyContent: &apos;flex-end&apos;, marginBottom: 36 } })What is flex: 1According to Basic concepts of flexbox The flex CSS property specifies how a flex item will grow or shrink so as to fit the space available in its flex container. This is a shorthand property that sets flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. and w3 flex: Equivalent to flex: 1 0. Makes the flex item flexible and sets the flex basis to zero, resulting in an item that receives the specified proportion of the free space in the flex container. If all items in the flex container use this pattern, their sizes will be proportional to the specified flex factor. In most browsers, flex: 1 equals 1 1 0 , which means flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink:1, flex-basis: 0 . The flex-grow and flex-shrink specifies how much the item will grow or shrink relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container. And the flex-basis specifies the initial length of a flexible item. In this case the bottom View will take up the remaining space. And in that space, we can have whatever flow we want. To move the button to the bottom, we use justifyContent to lay out items in the main axis, with flex-end , which aligns the flex items at the end of the container. A compositional approachWhile this works, code can be duplicated quickly as we need to do this in a lot of screens. All we need is to wrap this ImageButton inside a container . Let‚Äôs encapsulate this with a a utility function. Add this utils/moveToBottom.js import React from &apos;react&apos; import { View, StyleSheet } from &apos;react-native&apos; function moveToBottom(component) { return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; {component} &lt;/View&gt; ) } const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, justifyContent: &apos;flex-end&apos;, marginBottom: 36 } }) export default moveToBottomNow in our screen, we just need to import import moveToBottom from &apos;library/utils/moveToBottom&apos;and wrap our button { moveToBottom( &lt;ImageButton style={styles.button} title={strings.onboarding.welcome.button} onPress={() =&gt; { this.props.navigation.navigate(&apos;Term&apos;) }} /&gt; ) }This time, we have the same screen as before, but with more reusable code. Since the styles are inside our moveToBottom module, we don‚Äôt need to specify styles in our screen any more. Here is the full code import React from &apos;react&apos; import { View, StyleSheet, Image, Text, Button } from &apos;react-native&apos; import strings from &apos;res/strings&apos; import palette from &apos;res/palette&apos; import images from &apos;res/images&apos; import ImageButton from &apos;library/components/ImageButton&apos; import moveToBottom from &apos;library/utils/moveToBottom&apos; export default class Welcome extends React.Component { render() { return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; &lt;Image style={styles.logo} source={images.logo} /&gt; &lt;Image style={styles.image} source={images.placeholder} /&gt; &lt;Text style={styles.heading}&gt;{strings.onboarding.welcome.heading.toUpperCase()}&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;{strings.onboarding.welcome.text1}&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;{strings.onboarding.welcome.text2}&lt;/Text&gt; { moveToBottom( &lt;ImageButton style={styles.button} title={strings.onboarding.welcome.button} onPress={() =&gt; { this.props.navigation.navigate(&apos;Term&apos;) }} /&gt; ) } &lt;/View&gt; ) } } const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, alignItems: &apos;center&apos; }, logo: { marginTop: 70, marginBottom: 42, }, image: { }, heading: { ...palette.heading, ...{ marginTop: 40 } }, text: { ...palette.text, ...{ marginHorizontal: 8, marginVertical: 10 } } })How to pass component as parameterI have to admit that I initially implement moveToBottom using Component (we need uppercase since React has a convention of using initial uppercase for components) to embed the Component inside View function moveToBottom(Component) { return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; &lt;Component /&gt; &lt;/View&gt; ) }But this results in bundling error ExceptionsManager.js:84 Warning: React.createElement: type is invalid -- expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: &lt;ImageButton /&gt;. Did you accidentally export a JSX literal instead of a component?and ExceptionsManager.js:76 Invariant Violation: Invariant Violation: Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object.As this moment I release that the thing I pass in is actually an object, not a class , so I treat it as an object and it works function moveToBottom(component) { return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; {component} &lt;/View&gt; ) }marginBottom on AndroidIn the above moveToBottom function, I use marginBottom to have some margin from the bottom. This works on iOS but somehow does not have any effect in Android, and I use react-native 0.57.0 at the moment. This inconsistence can happen often in React Native development. A quick workaround is to perform platform check, we can make it into a nifty function in src/library/utils/check import { Platform } from &apos;react-native&apos; const check = { isAndroid: () =&gt; { return Platform.OS === &apos;android&apos; } } export default checkThen in moveToBottom , let ‚Äòs use paddingBottom in case of app running in Android const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, justifyContent: &apos;flex-end&apos;, paddingBottom: check.isAndroid ? 14 : 0 } })Where to go from hereIn this post, we go from absolute position to another container, get to know flex , how to add reusable function and how to correctly pass component as parameter.

The ability to have pull requests get built, tested and release builds get distributed to testers allows team to verify automated build and identify problems quickly. I ‚Äòve been using BuddyBuild for both iOS and Android apps and were very happy with it. The experience from creating new apps and deploying build is awesome. It works so well that Apple acquired it, which then lead to the fact that Android apps are no longer supported and new customers can‚Äôt register. We are one of those who are looking for new alternatives. We‚Äôve been using TravisCI, CircleCI and Jenkins to deploy to Fabric. There is also TeamCity that is promising. But after a quick survey with friends and people, Bitrise is the most recommended. So maybe I should try that. The thing I like about Bitrise is its wide range support of workflow. They are just scripts that execute certain actions, and most of them are open source. There‚Äôs also yml config file, but all things can be done using web interface, so I don‚Äôt need to look into pages of documentation just to get the configuration right. This post is not a promote for Bitrise, it is just about trying and adapting to new things. There is no eternal thing in tech, things come ad go fast. Below are some of the lessons I learn after using Bitrise, hope you find them useful. Variant to buildThere is no Android Build step in the default ‚Äòprimary‚Äô workflow, as primary is generally used for testing the code for every push. There is an Android Build step in the deploy workflow and the app gets built by running this workflow. However, I like to have the Android Build step in my primary workflow, so I added it there. Usually I want app module and stagingRelease build variant as we need to deploy staging builds to internal testers. If you go to Bitrise.yml tab you can see that the configuration file has been updated. This is very handy. I‚Äôve used some other CI services and I needed to lookup their documentation on how to make this yml work. Bump version code automaticallyI‚Äôve used some other CI services before and the app version code surely does not start from 0. So it makes sense that Bitrise can auto bump version code from the current number. There are some predefined steps in Workflow but they don‚Äôt serve my need For the Set Android Manifest Version code and name step, the source code is here so I understand what it does. It works by modify AndroidManifest.xml file using sed . This article Adjust your build number is not clear enough. sed -i.bak ‚Äús/android:versionCode=‚Äù\\‚Äù${VERSIONCODE}\\‚Äù‚Äù/android:versionCode=‚Äù\\‚Äù${CONFIG_new_version_code}\\‚Äù‚Äù/‚Äù ${manifest_file}In our projects, the versionCode is from an environment variable BUILD_NUMBER in Jenkins, so we need look up the same thing in Available Environment Variables, and it is BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER , which is a build number of the build on bitrise.io. This is how versionCode looks like in build.gradle versionCode (System.*getenv*(&quot;BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER&quot;) as Integer ?: System.*getenv*(&quot;BUILD_NUMBER&quot;) as Integer ?: 243)243 is the current version code of this project, so let‚Äôs go to app‚Äôs Settings and change Your next build number will be Deploy to FabricI hope Bitrise has its own Crash reporting tool. For now I use Crashlytics in Fabric. And despite that Bitrise can distribute builds to testers, I still need to cross deploy to Fabric for historial reasons. There is only script steps-fabric-crashlytics-beta-deploy to deploy IPA file for iOS apps, so we need something for Android. Fortunately I can use the Fabric plugin for gradle. Add Fabric pluginFollow Install Crashlytics via Gradle to add Fabric plugin. Basically you need to add these dependencies to your app ‚Äòs build.gradle buildscript { repositories { google() maven { url &apos;https://maven.fabric.io/public&apos; } } dependencies { classpath &apos;io.fabric.tools:gradle:1.+&apos; } } apply plugin: &apos;io.fabric&apos; dependencies { compile(&apos;com.crashlytics.sdk.android:crashlytics:2.9.4@aar&apos;) { transitive = true; } }and API credentials in Manifest file &lt;meta-data android:name=‚Äùio.fabric.ApiKey‚Äù android:value=‚Äù67ffdb78ce9cd50af8404c244fa25df01ea2b5bc‚Äù /&gt;Deploy commandModern Android Studio usually includes a gradlew execution file in the root of your project. Run ./gradlew tasks for the list of tasks that you app can perform, look for Build tasks that start with assemble . Read more Build your app from the command line You can execute all the build tasks available to your Android project using the Gradle wrapper command line tool. It‚Äôs available as a batch file for Windows (gradlew.bat) and a shell script for Linux and Mac (gradlew.sh), and it‚Äôs accessible from the root of each project you create with Android Studio. For me, I want to deploy staging release build variant, so I run. Check that the build is on Fabric. ./gradlew assembleStagingRelease crashlyticsUploadDistributionStagingReleaseManage tester groupGo to your app on Fabric.io and create group of testers. Note that alias that is generated for the group Go to your app‚Äôs build.gradle and add ext.betaDistributionGroupAliases=‚Äômy-internal-testers‚Äô to your desired productFlavors or buildTypes . For me I add to staging under productFlavors productFlavors { staging { // ‚Ä¶ ext.betaDistributionGroupAliases=‚Äôhyper-internal-testers-1&apos; } production { // ‚Ä¶ } }Now that the command is run correctly, let‚Äôs add that to Bitrise Gradle Run stepGo to Workflow tab and add a Gradle Run step and place it below Deploy to Bitrise.io step. Expand Config, and add assembleStagingRelease crashlyticsUploadDistributionStagingRelease to Gradle task to run . Now start a new build in Bitrise manually or trigger new build by making pull request, you can see that the version code is increased for every build, crossed build gets deployed to Fabric to your defined tester groups. As an alternative, you can also use Fabric/Crashlytics deployer, just update config with your apps key and secret found in settings. Where to go from hereI hope those tips are useful to you.

And here are some of my notes on it. Challenges The challenges with Facebook is it uses Safari controller, we we deal mostly with web view for now. Starting from iOS 9+, Facebook decided to use safari instead of native facebook app to avoid app switching. You can read the detail here Building the Best Facebook Login Experience for People on iOS 9 It does not have wanted accessibilityIdentifier or accessibilityLabel The webview content may change in the future üò∏ Create a Facebook test userLuckily, you don‚Äôt have to create your own Facebook user to test. Facebook supports test users that you can manage permissions and friends, very handy When creating the test user, you have the option to select language. That will be the displayed language in Safari web view. I choose Norwegian üá≥üá¥ for now Click the login button and show Facebook loginHere we use the default FBSDKLoginButton 123var showFacebookLoginFormButton: XCUIElement { return buttons[\"Continue with Facebook\"]} And then tap it 1app.showFacebookLoginFormButton.tap() Check login statusWhen going to safari Facebook form, user may have already logged in or not. So we need to handle these 2 cases. When user has logged in, Facebook will say something like ‚Äúyou have already logged in‚Äù or the OK button. The advice here is to put breakpoint and po app.staticTexts, po app.buttons to see which UI elements are at a certain point. You can check for the static text, or simply just the OK button 123var isAlreadyLoggedInSafari: Bool { return buttons[\"OK\"].exists || staticTexts[\"Du har allerede godkjent Blue Sea.\"].exists} Wait and refreshBut Facebook form is a webview, so its content is a bit dynamic. And UITest seems to cache content for fast query, so before checking staticTexts, we need to wait and refresh the cache 1app.clearCachedStaticTexts() This is the wait function 12345678910111213extension XCTestCase { func wait(for duration: TimeInterval) { let waitExpectation = expectation(description: \"Waiting\") let when = DispatchTime.now() + duration DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: when) { waitExpectation.fulfill() } // We use a buffer here to avoid flakiness with Timer on CI waitForExpectations(timeout: duration + 0.5) }} Wait for element to appearBut a more solid approach would be to wait for element to appear. For Facebook login form, they should display a Facebook label after loading. So we should wait for this element 123456789101112extension XCTestCase { /// Wait for element to appear func wait(for element: XCUIElement, timeout duration: TimeInterval) { let predicate = NSPredicate(format: \"exists == true\") let _ = expectation(for: predicate, evaluatedWith: element, handler: nil) // Here we don't need to call `waitExpectation.fulfill()` // We use a buffer here to avoid flakiness with Timer on CI waitForExpectations(timeout: duration + 0.5) }} And call this before you do any further inspection on elements in Facebook login form 1wait(for: app.staticTexts[\"Facebook\"], timeout: 5) If user is logged inAfter login, my app shows the main controller with a map view inside. So a basic test would be to check the existence of that map 1234567if app.isAlreadyLoggedInSafari { app.okButton.tap() handleLocationPermission() // Check for the map XCTAssertTrue(app.maps.element(boundBy: 0).exists)} Handle interruptionYou know that when showing the map with location, Core Location will ask for permission. So we need to handle that interruption as well. You need to ensure to call it early before the alert happens 123456fileprivate func handleLocationPermission() { addUIInterruptionMonitor(withDescription: \"Location permission\", handler: { alert in alert.buttons.element(boundBy: 1).tap() return true })} There is another problem, this monitor won‚Äôt be called. So the workaround is to call app.tap() again when the alert will happen. In my case, I call app.tap() when my map has been shown for 1,2 seconds, just to make sure app.tap() is called after alert is shown For a more detailed guide, please read https://github.com/onmyway133/blog/issues/48 If user is not logged inIn this case, we need to fill in email and password. You can take a look at the The full source code section below. When things don‚Äôt work or po does not show you the elements you needed, it‚Äôs probably because of caching or you need to wait until dynamic content finishes rendering. You need to wait for element to appear Tap on the text fieldYou may get Neither element nor any descendant has keyboard focus, here are the workaround If you test on Simulator, make sure Simulator -&gt; Hardware -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Connect Hardware Keyboard is not checked wait a bit after tap 1app.emailTextField.tap() Clear all the textThe idea is to move the caret to the end of the textField, then apply each delete key for each character, then type the next text 12345678910111213extension XCUIElement { func deleteAllText() { guard let string = value as? String else { return } let lowerRightCorner = coordinate(withNormalizedOffset: CGVector(dx: 0.9, dy: 0.9)) lowerRightCorner.tap() let deletes = string.characters.map({ _ in XCUIKeyboardKeyDelete }).joined(separator: \"\") typeText(deletes) }} Change languageFor my case, I want to test in Norwegian, so we need to find the Norwegian option and tap on that. It is identified as static text by UI Test 123var norwegianText: XCUIElement { return staticTexts[\"Norsk (bokm√•l)\"]} 12wait(for: app.norwegianText, timeout: 1)app.norwegianText.tap() The email text fieldLuckily, email text field is detected by UI Test as text field element, so we can query for that. This uses predicate 1234var emailTextField: XCUIElement { let predicate = NSPredicate(format: \"placeholderValue == %@\", \"E-post eller mobil\") return textFields.element(matching: predicate)} The password text fieldUI Test can‚Äôt seem to identify the password text field, so we need to search for it by coordinate 1234var passwordCoordinate: XCUICoordinate { let vector = CGVector(dx: 1, dy: 1.5) return emailTextField.coordinate(withNormalizedOffset: vector)} This is the document for func coordinate(withNormalizedOffset normalizedOffset: CGVector) -&gt; XCUICoordinate Creates and returns a new coordinate with a normalized offset.The coordinate‚Äôs screen point is computed by adding normalizedOffset multiplied by the size of the element‚Äôs frame to the origin of the element‚Äôs frame.

The many cool steps and workflows make Bitrise an ideal CI to try. Like any other CIs, the learning steps and configurations can be intimidating at first. Things that work locally can fail on CI, and how to send things that are marked as git ignore to be used in CI builds are popular issues. In this post I will show how to deploy React Native apps for both iOS and Android. The key thing to remember is to have the same setup on CI as you have locally. They are to ensure exact same versions for packages and tools, to be aware of file patterns in gitignore as those changes won‚Äôt be there on CI, and how to property use environment variables and secured files. This post tried to be intuitive with lots of screenshots. Hope you learn something and avoid the wasted hours that I have been too. Support for React NativeIn its simplest sense, React Native is just Javascript code with native iOS and Android projects, and Bitrise has a very good support for React Native. It scans ios and android folder, and give suggestion about scheme and build variants to build. Another good thing about Bitrise is its various useful steps and workflows. Unlike other CIs where we have to spend days on how to property edit the configuration file, Bitrise has a pretty good UI to add and edit steps. Steps are just custom scripts, and we can write pretty much what we like. Most of the predefined steps are open source. Here are a few Certificate and Profile Installer Install CocoaPods Slack message Gradle Runner Building for iOSUnless you use the step Build with Simulator , you will need provisioning profile and certificates with private keys in order to build for devices. Install React Native &amp; npm installReact Native moves fast and break things. If you don‚Äôt have same version of React Native, you will have hard time figuring out why the builds constantly fail on CI. Currently I use React Native 0.57.0, so I enter install react-native@0.57.0 to let Bitrise install the same version. But normally you just need to npm install as versions should be explicitly defined in package.json file. Also, we need to make sure we have the same version of react-native-cli with Install React Native step Install CocoaPodsIt‚Äôs safe to have the same CocoaPods version. For Xcode 10, we need at least CocoaPods 1.6.0.beta-1 to avoid the bug Skipping code signing because the target does not have an Info.plist file. Note that our Xcode project is inside ios folder, so we specify ./ios/Podfile for Podfile path Code signingUnder Workflow -&gt; Code Signing we can upload provisioning profiles and certificates. Then we need to use Certificate and profile install step to make use of the profiles and certificates we uploaded. iOS Auto ProvisionAnother option is to use the iOS Auto Provision step, but it requires that we need to have an account in team that has connected Apple Developer Account. This way Bitrise can autogenerate profiles for us. Sometimes you need to set Should the step try to generate Provisioning Profiles even if Xcode managed signing is enabled in the Xcode project? to yes Under Xcode Archive &amp; Export for iOS -&gt; Debug -&gt; Additional options for xcodebuild call We need to pass -allowProvisioningUpdates to make auto provisioning profile update happen. Recreate user schemeBitrise can autogenerate schemes with the Recreate user scheme step, but it‚Äôs good to mark our scheme as Shared in Xcode. This ensures consistence between local and CI builds. ArchiveTo archive project, we need to add Xcode Archive &amp; Export . For React Native, iOS project is inside ios folder, so we need to specify ./ios/MyApp.xcworkspace for Project path. Note that I use xcworkspace because I have CocoaPods Right now, as of React Native 0.57.0, it has problem running with the new build system in Xcode 10, so the quick fix is to use legacy build system. Under Xcode Archive &amp; Export step there are fields to add additional options for xcodebuild call. Enter -UseModernBuildSystem=NO You can read more Build System Release Notes for Xcode 10 Xcode 10 uses a new build system. The new build system provides improved reliability and build performance, and it catches project configuration problems that the legacy build system does not. Building for AndroidFor Android, the most troublesome task is to give keystore files to Bitrise as it is something we would keep privately from GitHub. Bitrise allows us to upload keystore file, but we also need to specify key alias and key password. One solution is to use Secrets and Environment variables But as we often use gradle.properties to specify custom variables for Gradle, it‚Äôs convenient to upload this file. Under Workflow -&gt; Code Signing is where we can upload keystore, as well as secured files The generated URL variables are path to our uploaded files. We can use curl to download them. Bitrise has also Generic File Storage step to download all secured files. The downloaded files is located at GENERIC_FILE_STORAGE , so we add another Custom Script step to copy those files into ./android folder #!/usr/bin/env bash cp $GENERIC_FILE_STORAGE/gradle.properties ./android/gradle.properties cp $GENERIC_FILE_STORAGE/my_app_android.keystore ./android/my_app_android.keystoreNote that the name of the files are the same of when we uploaded, and we use cp command to copy to folders. Android BuildBy default, Bitrise has 2 workflows: primary for quick start, and deploy for archiving and deploying. In the deploy workflow there is Android Build step. We can overwrite module and build variant here. If all go wellIn Bitrise we can mark a step to continue regardless of the previous step. I use this to make sure iOS build independently from Android If both iOS and Android build are successful, we should see the below summary Although Bitrise has a good UI to configure workflows and steps, we have fine grained control every parameters in the bitrise.yml file. It‚Äôs good to reason here as we get familiar with all the steps. Where to go from hereI hope you learn something and have a happy deploy.

Compared to Firebase Realtime Database, it has better querying and more structured data, together with ease manual fetching of data. The new structure of collection and document is probably the eye catching, this makes data more intuitive to users and query a breeze. From https://firebase.googleblog.com/2017/10/cloud-firestore-for-rtdb-developers.html In this post, I will show how to setup Firebase Cloud Firestore in React Native apps for both iOS and Android through, of course, some pain points. Then we create and fetch document in Firestore database. Firebase Javascript SDKMy first option is to go with Firebase Javascript SDK, as it worked well for me with Firebase Realtime Database. My use case is to just fetch and update Firestore collections, I think it does not involve much of native features. Furthermore, when possible I try to avoid native code as much as possible when dealing with React Native. So let‚Äôs try Get started with Cloud Firestore npm install firebaseThe version I install is 5.4.0. Next, import firebase and note that we need to import firestore as well const firebase = require(&quot;firebase&quot;); // Required for side-effects require(&quot;firebase/firestore&quot;);document is not definedThis issue made me bang against my desk for a while. As people have pointed out, it is because of document being accessed. var BrowserPlatform = /** @class */ (function () { function BrowserPlatform() { this.emptyByteString = &apos;&apos;; this.document = document; // delete this line this.window = window; // delete this line this.base64Available = typeof atob !== &apos;undefined&apos;; }The firestore component in the current Firebase Javascript SDK does not fully support React Native, so we need to work around or use beta version with npm install firebase@next . In the mean time, let‚Äôs try React Native Firebase. React Native FirebaseReading over at Cloud Firestore Library and framework integrations, React Native Firebase is recommended. Although some features from the Firebase Web SDK will generally work with React Native, it is mainly built for the web and as such has a limited compatible feature set. Source: https://rnfirebase.io/docs/v4.3.x/getting-started The below article and their starter app is the guiding star. The integration with native code in iOS and Android can be painful, but I React Native Firebase is very powerful as it has up-to-date wrappers around native Firebase SDK. Let ‚Äòs npm install react-native-firebase , the current version is 4.3.8 , and follow manual setup guide for existing project, this helps you learn more about the process and the bootstrap script. A quick lookFirst you need to Firebase console and add a project. A project allows many apps to stay, for example I have 4 apps (2 iOS, 2 Android) that have access to Firestore database. Head over to Database in the left menu, we can see a quick look into Firestore and its collection/document structure Setup for iOSFollow iOS Installation Guide Firstly, download GoogleService-Info.plist and place it in the correct folder, make sure it has been added to project via Xcode. Otherwise Firebase SDK causes app to crash right after start. Then add #import &lt;Firebase.h&gt; to AppDelegate.m and [FIRApp configure]; to function didFinishLaunchingWithOptions . Next create Podfile with pod init inside ios folder. For Firestore, you need Firebase/Firestore to prevent the error below You attempted to use a firebase module that‚Äôs not installed natively on your iOS project by calling firebase.firestore() And you shouldn‚Äôt use use_frameworks! as it gives error ‚ÄòFirebaseCore/FIRAnalyticsConfiguration.h‚Äô file not found platform :ios, &apos;9.0&apos; target &apos;FoodshopGuest&apos; do pod &apos;Firebase/Core&apos;, &apos;~&gt; 5.3.0&apos; pod &apos;Firebase/Firestore&apos;, &apos;~&gt; 5.3.0&apos; endIf you get framework not found FirebaseAnalytics , then make sure each target has $(inherited) at the top for Framework Search Paths Then run react-native link react-native-firebase and you should be good for iOS. Setup for AndroidAndroid is a bit less straightforward to setup than iOS. But it‚Äôs not impossible. Let‚Äôs follow Android Installation guide. Firstly, place google-services.json in android/app/google-services.json . Let‚Äôs also use Gradle 4.4 and Google Play Services 15.0.1 . Change gradle/gradle-wrapper.properties to use distributionUrl=https\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.4-all.zipBelow is my project build.gradle with compileSdkVersion 27 and buildToolsVersion 27.0.3 . Make sure google() stays above jcenter() // Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules. buildscript { repositories { mavenLocal() google() jcenter() maven { url &apos;[https://maven.google.com/&apos;](https://maven.google.com/&apos;) name &apos;Google&apos; } } dependencies { classpath &apos;com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.3&apos; classpath &apos;com.google.gms:google-services:4.0.1&apos; // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong // in the individual module build.gradle files } } allprojects { repositories { mavenLocal() google() jcenter() maven { // All of React Native (JS, Obj-C sources, Android binaries) is installed from npm url &quot;$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android&quot; } } } ext { buildToolsVersion = &quot;27.0.3&quot; minSdkVersion = 16 compileSdkVersion = 27 targetSdkVersion = 26 supportLibVersion = &quot;26.1.0&quot; }For my app module build.gradle , let‚Äôs have apply plugin: ‚Äòcom.google.gms.google-services‚Äô at the very bottom of the file, this is important. In dependencies section, you must have com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore to include Firestore component. dependencies { implementation project(&apos;:react-native-firebase&apos;) implementation fileTree(dir: &quot;libs&quot;, include: [&quot;*.jar&quot;]) implementation &quot;com.android.support:appcompat-v7:${rootProject.ext.supportLibVersion}&quot; // Firebase dependencies implementation &quot;com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:15.0.1&quot; implementation &quot;com.google.firebase:firebase-core:16.0.1&quot; implementation &quot;com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:17.0.2&quot; }Make sure there is no duplication of project(‚Äò:react-native-firebase‚Äô) .

If this was your intention, set `canOverrideExistingModule=true Then make sure your MainApplication.java has no duplication for new RNFirebasePackage() . Here is my MainApplication.java , note that you need import io.invertase.firebase.firestore.RNFirebaseFirestorePackage; in order to use RNFirebaseFirestorePackage package com.fantageek.foodshophost; import android.app.Application; import com.facebook.react.ReactApplication; import io.invertase.firebase.RNFirebasePackage; import io.invertase.firebase.firestore.RNFirebaseFirestorePackage; import com.facebook.react.ReactNativeHost; import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage; import com.facebook.react.shell.MainReactPackage; import com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader; import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.List; public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication { private final ReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost = new ReactNativeHost(this) { [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) public boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() { return BuildConfig.DEBUG; } [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) protected List&lt;ReactPackage&gt; getPackages() { return Arrays.&lt;ReactPackage&gt;asList( new MainReactPackage(), new RNFirebasePackage(), new RNFirebaseFirestorePackage() ); } [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) protected String getJSMainModuleName() { return &quot;index&quot;; } }; [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) public ReactNativeHost getReactNativeHost() { return mReactNativeHost; } [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override) public void onCreate() { super.onCreate(); SoLoader.init(this, /* native exopackage */ false); } }My rule of thumb is that you should always use Android Studio to perform Gradle sync or Build projectThere you should be able to see compile issues much easier. With all the steps above, compilation should succeed. One problem with running React Native on Android, if after react-native run-android and Metro keeps showing Loading dependency graph, done , then you should start emulator via Android Studio -&gt; AVD Manager or adb , the app should be already installed in the emulator, open the app and Metro will start loading again. Trying FirestoreReact Native Firebase should give you similar APIs to those in the web, so learn from Get data with Cloud Firestore for how to get or set documents. I like to organise services in separate files, here is how to reference firestore and load document. import firebase from &apos;react-native-firebase&apos; class FirebaseService { constructor() { this.ref = firebase.firestore().collection(&apos;people&apos;) } async load(id) { const doc = await this.ref.doc(id).get() if (doc.exists) { return doc.data() } else { const defaultDoc = { name: &quot;ABC&quot;, age: 2 } await this.ref.doc(id).set(defaultDoc) return doc } } } export const firebaseService = new FirebaseService()Where to go from hereI hope this article helps in setting up Firebase SDK in React Native apps.

If your app previously registered for remote notifications, calling the registerForRemoteNotifications method again does not incur any additional overhead, and iOS returns the existing device token to your app delegate immediately. In addition, iOS calls your delegate method any time the device token changes, not just in response to your app registering or re-registering The user can change the notification settings for your app at any time using the Settings app. Because settings can change, always call the registerUserNotificationSettings: at launch time and use the application:didRegisterUserNotificationSettings: method to get the response. If the user disallows specific notification types, avoid using those types when configuring local and remote notifications for your app. didReceiveRemoteNotificationAbout application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: Implement the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: method instead of this one whenever possible. If your delegate implements both methods, the app object calls the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: method. If the app is not running when a remote notification arrives, the method launches the app and provides the appropriate information in the launch options dictionary. The app does not call this method to handle that remote notification. Instead, your implementation of the application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions: or application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method needs to get the remote notification payload data and respond appropriately. About application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: This is for silent push notification with content-available Unlike the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: method, which is called only when your app is running in the foreground, the system calls this method when your app is running in the foreground or background In addition, if you enabled the remote notifications background mode, the system launches your app (or wakes it from the suspended state) and puts it in the background state when a push notification arrives. However, the system does not automatically launch your app if the user has force-quit it. In that situation, the user must relaunch your app or restart the device before the system attempts to launch your app automatically again. If the user opens your app from the system-displayed alert, the system may call this method again when your app is about to enter the foreground so that you can update your user interface and display information pertaining to the notification. How to handleUsually, the use of push notification is to display a specific article, a specific DetailViewController, ‚Ä¶ in your app. So the good practices are When the app is in foreground: Gently display some kind of alert view and ask the user whether he would like to go to that specific page or not When user is brought from background to foreground, or from terminated to foreground: Just navigate to that specific page. For example, if you use UINavigationController, you can set that specific page the top most ViewController, if you use UITabBarController, you can set that specific page the selected tab, something like that 1234567891011- func handlePushNotification(userInfo: NSDictionary) { // Check applicationState if (applicationState == UIApplicationStateActive) { // Application is running in foreground showAlertForPushNotification(userInfo) } else if (applicationState == UIApplicationStateBackground || applicationState == UIApplicationStateInactive) { // Application is brought from background or launched after terminated handlePushNotification(userInfo) }} Here we create another method `handlePushNotification:`` to handle push notification.

If app was not killed by user, it is woke up and state changed to UIApplicationStateInactive.

If you forget, here is the link to part 1. Link to Github In the first part, we learn about the idea, the structure of the project and how MainActivity uses the MainLayout. Now we learn how to actually implement the MainLayout DISPLAY MENU AND CONTENT VIEWFirst we have MainLayout as a subclass of LinearLayout 1public class MainLayout extends LinearLayout We then need declare the constructors 1234567public MainLayout(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) { super(context, attrs); } public MainLayout(Context context) { super(context); } and override some useful methods 1234567891011@Override protected void onAttachedToWindow() { super.onAttachedToWindow(); // Get our 2 child View menu = this.getChildAt(0); content = this.getChildAt(1); // Initially hide the menu menu.setVisibility(View.GONE); } onAttachedToWindow() is called when MainLayout is attached to window. At this point it has a Surface and will start drawing. Note that this function is guaranteed to be called before onDraw. Here we set child views to our view and content variable 12menu = this.getChildAt(0);content = this.getChildAt(1); and initially hide the menu. Note that View.GONE tells the view to not take up space in the layout 1menu.setVisibility(View.GONE); In onMeasure(), we compute menuRightMargin, this variable is the amount of right space the menu should not occupy. In this case, we want the menu to take up 90% amount of the screen width. onMeasure() is called to ask all children to measure themselves and compute the measurement of this layout based on the children 12345@Override protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) { super.onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec); menuRightMargin = mainLayoutWidth * 10 / 100; } Finally, we need to override onLayout(), this is called from layout when this view should assign a size and position to each of its children. This is where we position the menu and content view. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223@Override protected void onLayout(boolean changed, int left, int top, int right, int bottom) { // True if MainLayout 's size and position has changed // If true, calculate child views size if(changed) { // Note: LayoutParams are used by views to tell their parents how they want to be laid out // content View occupies the full height and width LayoutParams contentLayoutParams = (LayoutParams)content.getLayoutParams(); contentLayoutParams.height = this.getHeight(); contentLayoutParams.width = this.getWidth(); // menu View occupies the full height, but certain width LayoutParams menuLayoutParams = (LayoutParams)menu.getLayoutParams(); menuLayoutParams.height = this.getHeight(); menuLayoutParams.width = this.getWidth() - menuRightMargin; } // Layout the child views menu.layout(left, top, right - menuRightMargin, bottom); content.layout(left + contentXOffset, top, right + contentXOffset, bottom); } Note for the use of the contentXOffset variable. It is the content that is moving, not the menu. So contentXOffset is used to translate the content horizontally when it is moving ADDING ANIMATIONSo the main idea of sliding menu is to change contentXOffset and call offsetLeftAndRight for the content to move the content. But for the content ‚Äòs new position to survive, we need to actually layout it on onLayout(), as shown in previous code snippet For more information, see Flyin menu using offsetLeftAndRight not preserving after a layout To better control sliding state, we declare MenuState enumeration 123456private enum MenuState { HIDING, HIDDEN, SHOWING, SHOWN, }; HIDDEN state is when menu is fully hidden, and SHOWN state is when menu is fully shown. HIDDING state is when menu is about to hide, and SHOWING state is when menu is about to show. Initially currentMenuState is set to HIDDEN so that the menu won‚Äôt show up on first launch. The main method of our MainLayout is toggleMenu, which, as it name implied, allow us to toggle menu 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627public void toggleMenu() { // Do nothing if sliding is in progress if(currentMenuState == MenuState.HIDING || currentMenuState == MenuState.SHOWING) return; switch(currentMenuState) { case HIDDEN: currentMenuState = MenuState.SHOWING; menu.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); menuScroller.startScroll(0, 0, menu.getLayoutParams().width, 0, SLIDING_DURATION); break; case SHOWN: currentMenuState = MenuState.HIDING; menuScroller.startScroll(contentXOffset, 0, -contentXOffset, 0, SLIDING_DURATION); break; default: break; } // Begin querying menuHandler.postDelayed(menuRunnable, QUERY_INTERVAL); // Invalite this whole MainLayout, causing onLayout() to be called this.invalidate(); } Here we use a Scroller to faciliate sliding animation. Note that Scroller does not perform any visual effect, it is just a base for us to track animation by querying the Scroller‚Äôs methods. Bills has a good answer on SO Android: Scroller Animation? The Scroller uses a custom Interpolator to make the sliding more natural. It moves faster in the end. The formula is here 1interpolator(t) = (t-1)5 + 1 If the menu is in HIDDEN state, we set its visibility to VISIBLE and start scrolling. Here the content is moving horizontally, so we scroll from left edge to menu width. Note that menu takes up only 90% of the screen width. If the menu is in SHOWN state, we start scrolling from the content ‚Äòs current x position to the left edge. The 3rd parameter to the startScroll() method is the distance we want to scroll, a negative sign indicates that we want to scroll from right to left. You can tweak SLIDING_DURATION and QUERY_INTERVAL to your desire. SLIDING_DURATION is the duration of the scrolling. QUERY_INTERVAL is how often we perform querying the Scroller for information. I set it to 16ms so that we have an fps of about 60, which is too high :D Here the querying is achieved via calling adjustContentPosition() in MenuRunnable 12// Begin queryingmenuHandler.postDelayed(menuRunnable, QUERY_INTERVAL); 12345678// Query Scrollerprotected class MenuRunnable implements Runnable { @Override public void run() { boolean isScrolling = menuScroller.computeScrollOffset(); adjustContentPosition(isScrolling); } } Here we call computeScrollOffset to check if the scrolling is finished or not 12345678910111213141516171819private void adjustContentPosition(boolean isScrolling) { int scrollerXOffset = menuScroller.getCurrX(); //Log.d(\"MainLayout.java adjustContentPosition()\", \"scrollerOffset \" + scrollerOffset); // Translate content View accordingly content.offsetLeftAndRight(scrollerXOffset - contentXOffset); contentXOffset = scrollerXOffset; // Invalite this whole MainLayout, causing onLayout() to be called this.invalidate(); // Check if animation is in progress if (isScrolling) menuHandler.postDelayed(menuRunnable, QUERY_INTERVAL); else this.onMenuSlidingComplete(); } We base on getCurrX to update out contentXOffset and translate content view. Remember to call invalidate() everytime the content position is changed. We continue moving the content view until scrolling is finished Finally, in onMenuSlidingComplete(), we set the currentMenuState accordingly 12345678910111213private void onMenuSlidingComplete() { switch (currentMenuState) { case SHOWING: currentMenuState = MenuState.SHOWN; break; case HIDING: currentMenuState = MenuState.HIDDEN; menu.setVisibility(View.GONE); break; default: return; } } HANDLING GESTURETo support gesture, we first attach OnTouchListener to the content view. We do this in onMeasure() 123456content.setOnTouchListener(new OnTouchListener() { @Override public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) { return MainLayout.this.onContentTouch(v, event); } }); And in onContentTouch() we handle the ACTION_DOWN, ACTION_MOVE and ACTION_UP to allow dragging the content view Please note that we use getRawX() instead of getX() for consistent behavior. More information see PeyloW ‚Äòs answer here How do I know if a MotionEvent is relative or absolute? Here I use curX and diffX to track previous position and how the difference in distance. When user is dragging, we continuously update the content view ‚Äòs position. Please also prevent user from dragging beyond the left edge and right margin border When the user release his/her finger, we base on lastDiffX to decide if the menu should show or hide. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364656667686970717273747576777879808182838485868788899091public boolean onContentTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) { // Do nothing if sliding is in progress if(currentMenuState == MenuState.HIDING || currentMenuState == MenuState.SHOWING) return false; // getRawX returns X touch point corresponding to screen // getX sometimes returns screen X, sometimes returns content View X int curX = (int)event.getRawX(); int diffX = 0; switch(event.getAction()) { case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN: //Log.d(\"MainLayout.java onContentTouch()\", \"Down x \" + curX); prevX = curX; return true; case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE: //Log.d(\"MainLayout.java onContentTouch()\", \"Move x \" + curX); // Set menu to Visible when user start dragging the content View if(!isDragging) { isDragging = true; menu.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); } // How far we have moved since the last position diffX = curX - prevX; // Prevent user from dragging beyond border if(contentXOffset + diffX &lt;= 0) { // Don't allow dragging beyond left border // Use diffX will make content cross the border, so only translate by -contentXOffset diffX = -contentXOffset; } else if(contentXOffset + diffX &gt; mainLayoutWidth - menuRightMargin) { // Don't allow dragging beyond menu width diffX = mainLayoutWidth - menuRightMargin - contentXOffset; } // Translate content View accordingly content.offsetLeftAndRight(diffX); contentXOffset += diffX; // Invalite this whole MainLayout, causing onLayout() to be called this.invalidate(); prevX = curX; lastDiffX = diffX; return true; case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP: //Log.d(\"MainLayout.java onContentTouch()\", \"Up x \" + curX); Log.d(\"MainLayout.java onContentTouch()\", \"Up lastDiffX \" + lastDiffX); // Start scrolling // Remember that when content has a chance to cross left border, lastDiffX is set to 0 if(lastDiffX &gt; 0) { // User wants to show menu currentMenuState = MenuState.SHOWING; // No need to set to Visible, because we have set to Visible in ACTION_MOVE //menu.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); //Log.d(\"MainLayout.java onContentTouch()\", \"Up contentXOffset \" + contentXOffset); // Start scrolling from contentXOffset menuScroller.startScroll(contentXOffset, 0, menu.getLayoutParams().width - contentXOffset, 0, SLIDING_DURATION); } else if(lastDiffX &lt; 0) { // User wants to hide menu currentMenuState = MenuState.HIDING; menuScroller.startScroll(contentXOffset, 0, -contentXOffset, 0, SLIDING_DURATION); } // Begin querying menuHandler.postDelayed(menuRunnable, QUERY_INTERVAL); // Invalite this whole MainLayout, causing onLayout() to be called this.invalidate(); // Done dragging isDragging = false; prevX = 0; lastDiffX = 0; return true; default: break; } return false; }","link":"/blog/Make-your-own-sliding-menu-on-Android-tutorial-Part-2/"},{"title":"Make your own sliding menu on Android tutorial - Part 1","text":"Issue #151 This post was from long time ago when I did Android I can‚Äôt deny that Facebook is so amazing, they made trends and people want to follow. That is the case of the sliding menu. Searching many threads on SO, like these create android Sliding Menu like Facebook,gmail, Android sliding menu similar to the one on facebook, Android - Sliding menu with sub menu ‚Ä¶ they will mostly introduce you to some good sliding menu libraries, like this SlidingMenu and some tutorials on how to use it. And of course, not forget to mention the Navigation Drawer that shipped with the Android SDK If you are a do-it-yourself guy like me, then here is the tutorial for you. It is mostly based on the following Youtube videos and guides Creating a Slide-In Menu in Android - Part 1: Showing the menu Creating a Slide-In Menu in Adnroid - Part 2: Adding animation The Making of Prixing #1: Fly-in App Menu The Making of Prixing #2: Swiping the Fly-in App Menu The Making of Prixing #3: Polishing the Sliding App Menu WHAT WILL WE ACHIEVEThe final result of this tutorial will look like this. User will then be able to get the menu by touching the Menu button, or just by dragging. The menu contains a list of Android UI controls and when selected, the main content view will shows the according screen. The source code is available on Github THE IDEAA sliding menu app typically has 2 views : the menu view (the green rectangle) and the content view (the red rectangle) We have many ways to implement the sliding effect, all depend on your intention Let the menu view hold still, while moving the content view. The content view usually sits on top of the menu view and cover the entire screen Opposite of 1. Let the content view hold still, while moving the menu view. The menu usually sits on top of the content view and occupy some amount of space, so that user can touch and drag it The same as 2. but when the menu is moving, the content is moving, too. When the menu is shown, we should disable interacting with the content view. The 1st solution is what we will do in this tutorial. It‚Äôs much the same with Facebook sliding menu OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECTFor better understanding, you should take a look at the project to see how things are organized /src/com.entropy.slidingmenu2 MainActivity.java : this should be your first screen. It contains the MainLayout and handle ListView click event to display the right content /src/com.entropy.slidingmenu2.fragment FragmentMain.java : the default content view FragmentButton.java : show one button on the content view The content view is really simple since it‚Äôs just for demo. I use Fragment so we can easily change the content view according to the ListView item selected /src/com.entropy.slidingmenu2.layout MainLayout.java : the most important part of this tutorial. For ease and reusability, it‚Äôs best to create a custom LinearLayout. This will be used to position the menu and content views appropriately and handle sliding effect /res/layout activity.main: represent the visual structure for MainLayout fragment_main: represent the content view THE PREPARATIONI list here the required knowledge just for reference Fragment : used to show the content view Support library : we use v4 in this tutorial to support Fragment for older devices Custom layout : our MainLayout is a custom layout Scroller : to facilitate the sliding animation Gesture : to allow drag and drop Without further ado, let‚Äôs get started DESIGNING activity_main.xmlThe activity_main.xml represents the content of our custom layout. Since its a custom layout, we must declare like this 123&lt;com.entropy.slidingmenu2.layout.MainLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" android:layout_width=\"match_parent\" android:layout_height=\"match_parent\" &gt; Inside it are the 2 LinearLayout. Both are declared with attributes but the final display will be decided by the code :) 12android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"android:layout_height=\"match_parent\" The first is for the menu, which holds a ListView The second is for the content, which holds the simulated action bar ^^ and the FrameLayout. The FrameLayout is where fragments will show up WORKING WITH MainActivity.javaThe MainActivity is the default activity, it contains our MainLayout and handle menu item selection In the onCreate() method, we do the following Inflate the MainLayout and its as the contentView for our activity 12mainLayout = (MainLayout)this.getLayoutInflater().inflate(R.layout.activity_main, null);setContentView(mainLayout); Init the ListView for the menu 1234567891011lvMenuItems = getResources().getStringArray(R.array.menu_items); lvMenu = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.activity_main_menu_listview); lvMenu.setAdapter(new ArrayAdapter(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, lvMenuItems)); lvMenu.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() { @Override public void onItemClick(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; parent, View view, int position, long id) { onMenuItemClick(parent, view, position, id); } }); Init the menu button 12345678btMenu = (Button) findViewById(R.id.activity_main_content_button_menu); btMenu.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { // Show/hide the menu toggleMenu(v); } }); Display FragmentMain as the initial Fragment for our content view 123456FragmentManager fm = MainActivity.this.getSupportFragmentManager();FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();FragmentMain fragment = new FragmentMain();ft.add(R.id.activity_main_content_fragment, fragment);ft.commit(); The toggleMenu() is a utility method to toggle the menu, it will calls MainLayout ‚Äòs toggleMenu() method. We ‚Äòll talk about this later onMenuItemClick() is used to handle menu item selection. What it does is to create the according Fragment and replace it with the current one Handle the Back button. If the menu is shown, we should hide it, or we can quit the app 123456789@Override public void onBackPressed() { if (mainLayout.isMenuShown()) { mainLayout.toggleMenu(); } else { super.onBackPressed(); } } Let‚Äôs continue to part 2","link":"/blog/Make-your-own-sliding-menu-on-Android-tutorial-Part-1/"},{"title":"Support IP handover in rtpproxy for VoIP applications","text":"Issue #304 If you do VoIP applications, especially with open sources like pjsip, you may encounter kamalio and rtpproxy to serve SIP requests. Due to limitation of NAT traversals, rtpproxy is needed to work around NAT. All SIP handshake requests go through a proxy server, but rtpproxy can also relay voice, video or any RTP stream of data. When I played with rtpproxy, it was before version 2.0 and I need to handle IP handover. This refers to the scenario when user switches between different network, for example from Wifi to 4G and they get new IP. Normally this means ending in the SIP call, but the expectation is that we can retry and continue the call if possible for users. That‚Äôs why I forked rtpproxy and add IP handover support. You can check the GitHub repo at rtpproxy. Use src_cnt to track the number of consecutive packets from different address. When this number exceeds THRESHOLD (10 for RTP and 2 for RTCP), I switch to this new address This way Client can ALWAYS change IP when he switches from 3G to Wifi, or from this Wifi hotspot to another There‚Äôs no chance for attack, unless attacker sends &gt; 10 (RTP THRESHOLD) packets in 20ms (supposed my client sends packets every 20ms) This idea is borrowed from http://www.pjsip.org/pjmedia/docs/html/group__PJMEDIA__CONFIG.htm There is a macro PJMEDIA_RTP_NAT_PROBATION_CNT. Basically, it is ‚ÄúSee if source address of RTP packet is different than the configured address, and switch RTP remote address to source packet address after several consecutive packets have been received.‚Äù Mobile clients now change IP frequently, from these hotspots to those. So if rtpproxy can support this feature, it would be nicer.

Firstly we nee to create a file called pre-commit, and place it into, for example, /Users/khoa/hooks: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526#!/bin/sh# https://appventure.me/2016/04/04/prevent-accidental-test-code-commits/if git rev-parse --verify HEAD &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1then against=HEADelse # Initial commit: diff against an empty tree object against=4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904fi# The special marker tag to mark things which we still need to changemarker=\"&lt;TEST&gt;\"# Redirect output to stderr.exec 1&gt;&amp;2if test $(git diff --cached -z $against | grep $marker | wc -c) != 0 then cat &lt;&lt;\\EOF Error: Still has invalid debug markers in code:EOF echo `git diff --cached -z $against -G $marker` exit 1fi In your project, run git config core.hooksPath /Users/khoa/hooks.

React Native is a cool concept, but things that sound good in theory may not work well in practice. Another layer of abstractionUp until now, I still don‚Äôt get why big companies choose React Native over native ones, as in the end what we do is to deliver good experience to the end user, not the easy development for developers. I have seen companies saying goodbye to React Native and people saying that React Native is just React philosophy learn once, write anywhere, that they choose React Native mainly for the React style, not for cross platform development. But the fact can‚Äôt be denied that people choose React Native mostly for cross platform development. Write once, deploy many places is so compelling. We still of course need to tweak a bit for each platform, but most of the code is reuse. I have to confess that I myself spend less time developing than digging into compiling and bundling issues. Nothing comes for free. To be successful with React Native, not only we need strong understanding on both iOS and Android, but also ready to step into solving issues. We can‚Äôt just open issues, pray and wait and hope someone solves it. We can‚Äôt just use other dependencies blindly and call it a day. A trivial bug can be super hard to fix in React Native, and our projects can‚Äôt wait. Big companies have, of course, enough resource to solve issues, but for small teams, React Native is a trade off decision to consider. A wrapper for a wrapperEnough about that. Let‚Äôs go to official React Native getting started guide. It recommend create-react-native-app. As someone who made electron.js apps and used create-react-app, I choose create-react-native-app right away, as I think it is the equivalent in terms of creating React Native apps. I know there is react-native init and though that it must have some problems, otherwise people don‚Äôt introduce create-react-native-app. After playing with create-react-native-app and eject, and after that read carefully through its caveats, I know it‚Äôs time to use just react-native init . In the end I just need a quick way to bootstrap React Native app with enough tooling (Babel, JSX, Hot reloading), however create-react-native-app is just a limited experience in Expo with opinionated services like Expo push notification docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/push-notifications.html and connectivity to Google Cloud Platform and AWS. I know every thing has its use case, but in this case it‚Äôs not the tool for me. Dependencies are the root of all evils, and React Native already has a lot, I don‚Äôt want more unnecessary things. The concept of Expo is actually nice, in that it allows newbie to step into React Native fast with recommended tooling already set up, and the ability to reject later. It also useful in sharing Snack to help reproduce issues. But the name of the repo create-react-native-app is a bit misleading. Maybe it‚Äôs just me, or ‚Ä¶ dev.to/kylessg/ive-released-over-100-apps-in-react-native-since-2015-ask-me-anything-1m9g No, I would never use Expo for a serious project. I imagine what ends up happening in most projects is they reach a point where they have to ultimately eject the app (e.g. needing a native module) which sounds very painful. dev.to/gaserd/why-i-do-not-use-expo-for-react-native-dont-panic-1bp If you use EXPO, you use wrapper-wrapper. hackernoon.com/understanding-expo-for-react-native-7bf23054bbcd Expo is a great tool for getting started quickly with React Native. However, it‚Äôs not always something that can get you to the finish line. From what I‚Äôve seen, the Expo team is making a lot of great decisions with their product roadmap. But their rapid pace of development has often led to bugs in new features. docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/why-not-expo JS and assets managed by Expo require connectivity to Google Cloud Platform and AWS #516 http://www.albertgao.xyz/2018/05/30/24-tips-for-react-native-you-probably-want-to-know If you are coming from web world, you need to know that create-react-native-app is not the create-react-app equivalentBut if you want more control over your project, something like tweaking your react native Android and iOS project, I highly suggest you use the official react-native-cli. Still, one simple command, react-native init ProjectName, and you are good to go. medium.com/@paulsc/react-native-first-impressions-expo-vs-native-9565cce44c92 I wish I would have used ‚ÄúNative‚Äù from the get go, instead I wasted quite a bit of time with ExpoMaybe the biggest one for me is that the whole thing feels like adding another layer of indirection and complexity to an already complicated stackI wish Expo would get removed from the react-native Getting Started guide to avoid confusing new arrivals levelup.gitconnected.com/how-i-ditched-expo-for-pure-react-native-fc0375361307 The Expo dev team did a lot of good stuff there, and they are all doing it for free, so I definitely want to thank all of them for providing a smoother entrance to this world. If they ever manage to solve this issue of custom native code somehow, it may become my platform of choice again. https://medium.com/@aswinmohanme/how-i-reduced-the-size-of-my-react-native-app-by-86-27be72bba640 I love everything about Expo except the size of the binaries. Each binary weighs around 25 MB regardless of your app.So the first thing I did was to migrate my existing Expo app to React Native. https://medium.com/react-native-training/best-practices-for-creating-react-native-apps-part-1-66311c746df3 If you are new to React Native and you think this is the ‚Äúmust‚Äù way to go. Check if it meets your needs first.If you are planning to use third party RN packages that have custom native modules. Expo does not support this functionality and in that case, you will have to eject Expo-Kit. In my opinion, if you are going to eject any kit, don‚Äôt use it in the first place. It will probably make things harder than if you hadn‚Äôt used the kit at all.","link":"/blog/What-is-create-react-native-app/"},{"title":"How to structure your project and manage static resources in React Native","text":"Issue #256 Original post https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-structure-your-project-and-manage-static-resources-in-react-native-6f4cfc947d92 React and React Native are just frameworks, and they do not dictate how we should structure our projects. It all depends on your personal taste and the project you‚Äôre working on. In this post, we will go through how to structure a project and how to manage local assets. This of course is not written in stone, and you are free to apply only the pieces that suit you. Hope you learn something. For a project bootstrapped with react-native init , we get only the basic structure. There is the ios folder for Xcode projects, the android folder for Android projects, and an index.js and an App.js file for the React Native starting point. ios/ android/ index.js App.jsAs someone who has worked with native on both Windows Phone, iOS and Android, I find that structuring a project all comes down to separating files by type or feature type vs featureSeparating by type means that we organise files by their type. If it is a component, there are container and presentational files. If it is Redux, there are action, reducer, and store files. If it is view, there are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files. Group by typeredux actions store reducers components container presentational view javascript html cssThis way, we can see the type of each file, and easily run a script toward a certain file type. This is general for all projects, but it does not answer the question ‚Äúwhat is this project about?‚Äù Is it news application? Is it a loyalty app? Is it about nutrition tracking? Organising files by type is for a machine, not for a human. Many times we work on a feature, and finding files to fix in multiple directories is a hassle. It‚Äôs also a pain if we plan to make a framework out of our project, as files are spread across many places. Group by featureA more reasonable solution is to organise files by feature. Files related to a feature should be placed together. And test files should stay close to the source files. Check out this article to learn more. A feature can be related to login, sign up, onboarding, or a user‚Äôs profile. A feature can contain sub-features as long as they belong to the same flow. If we wanted to move the sub feature around, it would be easy, as all related files are already grouped together. My typical project structure based on features looks like this: index.js App.js ios/ android/ src screens login LoginScreen.js LoginNavigator.js onboarding OnboardingNavigator welcome WelcomeScreen.js term TermScreen.js notification NotificationScreen.js main MainNavigator.js news NewsScreen.js profile ProfileScreen.js search SearchScreen.js library package.json components ImageButton.js RoundImage.js utils moveToBottom.js safeArea.js networking API.js Auth.js res package.json strings.js colors.js palette.js fonts.js images.js images logo@2x.png logo@3x.png button@2x.png button@3x.png scripts images.js clear.jsBesides the traditional files App.js and index.js and the ios1 and android folders, I put all the source files inside the src folder. Inside src I have res for resources, library for common files used across features, and screens for a screen of content. As few dependencies as possibleSince React Native is heavily dependent on tons of dependencies, I try to be pretty aware when adding more. In my project I use just react-navigation for navigation. And I‚Äôm not a fan of redux as it adds unneeded complexity. Only add a dependency when you really need it, otherwise you are just setting yourself up for more trouble than value. The thing I like about React is the components. A component is where we define view, style and behavior. React has inline style ‚Äî it‚Äôs like using JavaScript to define script, HTML and CSS. This fits the feature approach we are aiming for. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt use styled-components. Since styles are just JavaScript objects, we can just share comment styles in library . srcI like Android a lot, so I name src and res to match its folder conventions. react-native init sets up babel for us. But for a typical JavaScript project, it‚Äôs good to organise files in the src folder. In my electron.js application IconGenerator, I put the source files inside the src folder. This not only helps in terms of organising, but also helps babel transpile the entire folder at once. Just a command and I have the files in src transpiled to dist in a blink. babel ./src --out-dir ./dist --copy-filesScreenReact is based around components. Yup. There are container and presentational components, but we can compose components to build more complex components. They usually end in showing in the full screen. It is called Page in Windows Phone, ViewController in iOS and Activity in Android. The React Native guide mentions screen very often as something that covers the entire space: Mobile apps are rarely made up of a single screen. Managing the presentation of, and transition between, multiple screens is typically handled by what is known as a navigator. index.js or not?Each screen is considered the entry point for each feature. You can rename the LoginScreen.js to index.js by leveraging the Node module feature: Modules don‚Äôt have to be files. We can also create a find-me folder under node_modules and place an index.js file in there. The same require(‚Äòfind-me‚Äô) line will use that folder‚Äôs index.js file So instead of import LoginScreen from ‚Äò./screens/LoginScreen‚Äô , we can just do import LoginScreen from ‚Äò./screens‚Äô. Using index.js results in encapsulation and provides a public interface for the feature. This is all personal taste. I myself prefer explicit naming for a file, hence the name LoginScreen.js. Navigatorreact-navigation seems to be the most popular choice for handling navigation in a React Native app. For a feature like onboarding, there are probably many screens managed by a stack navigation, so there is OnboardingNavigator . You can think of Navigator as something that groups sub screens or features. Since we group by feature, it‚Äôs reasonable to place Navigator inside the feature folder. It basically looks like this: import { createStackNavigator } from &apos;react-navigation&apos; import Welcome from &apos;./Welcome&apos; import Term from &apos;./Term&apos; const routeConfig = { Welcome: { screen: Welcome }, Term: { screen: Term } } const navigatorConfig = { navigationOptions: { header: null } } export default OnboardingNavigator = createStackNavigator(routeConfig, navigatorConfig)libraryThis is the most controversial part of structuring a project. If you don‚Äôt like the name library, you can name it utilities, common, citadel , whatever‚Ä¶ This is not meant for homeless files, but it is where we place common utilities and components that are used by many features. Things like atomic components, wrappers, quick fixes function, networking stuff, and login info are used a lot, and it‚Äôs hard to move them to a specific feature folder. Sometimes we just need to be practical and get the work done. In React Native, we often need to implement a button with an image background in many screens. Here is a simple one that stays inside library/components/ImageButton.js . The components folder is for reusable components, sometimes called atomic components. According to React naming conventions, the first letter should be uppercase. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738import React from 'react'import { TouchableOpacity, View, Image, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'import images from 'res/images'import colors from 'res/colors'export default class ImageButton extends React.Component { render() { return ( &lt;TouchableOpacity style={styles.touchable} onPress={this.props.onPress}&gt; &lt;View style={styles.view}&gt; &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;{this.props.title}&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;/View&gt; &lt;Image source={images.button} style={styles.image} /&gt; &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt; ) }}const styles = StyleSheet.create({ view: { position: 'absolute', backgroundColor: 'transparent' }, image: { }, touchable: { alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }, text: { color: colors.button, fontSize: 18, textAlign: 'center' }}) And if we want to place the button at the bottom, we use a utility function to prevent code duplication. Here is library/utils/moveToBottom.js: import React from &apos;react&apos; import { View, StyleSheet } from &apos;react-native&apos; function moveToBottom(component) { return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; {component} &lt;/View&gt; ) } const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, justifyContent: &apos;flex-end&apos;, marginBottom: 36 } }) export default moveToBottomUse package.json to avoid relative pathThen somewhere in the src/screens/onboarding/term/Term.js , we can import by using relative paths: import moveToBottom from &apos;../../../../library/utils/move&apos; import ImageButton from &apos;../../../../library/components/ImageButton&apos;This is a big red flag in my eyes. It‚Äôs error prone, as we need to calculate how many .. we need to perform. And if we move feature around, all of the paths need to be recalculated. Since library is meant to be used many places, it‚Äôs good to reference it as an absolute path. In JavaScript there are usually 1000 libraries to a single problem. A quick search on Google reveals tons of libraries to tackle this issue. But we don‚Äôt need another dependency as this is extremely easy to fix. The solution is to turn library into a module so node can find it. Adding package.json to any folder makes it into a Node module . Add package.json inside the library folder with this simple content: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;library&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.1&quot; }Now in Term.js we can easily import things from library because it is now a module: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435import React from 'react'import { View, StyleSheet, Image, Text, Button } from 'react-native'import strings from 'res/strings'import palette from 'res/palette'import images from 'res/images'import ImageButton from 'library/components/ImageButton'import moveToBottom from 'library/utils/moveToBottom'export default class Term extends React.Component { render() { return ( &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt; &lt;Text style={styles.heading}&gt;{strings.onboarding.term.heading.toUpperCase()}&lt;/Text&gt; { moveToBottom( &lt;ImageButton style={styles.button} title={strings.onboarding.term.button.toUpperCase()} /&gt; ) } &lt;/View&gt; ) }}const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, alignItems: 'center' }, heading: { ...palette.heading, ...{ marginTop: 72 } }}) resYou may wonder what res/colors, res/strings , res/images and res/fonts are in the above examples. Well, for front end projects, we usually have components and style them using fonts, localised strings, colors, images and styles. JavaScript is a very dynamic language, and it‚Äôs easy to use stringly types everywhere. We could have a bunch of #00B75D color across many files, or Fira as a fontFamily in many Text components. This is error-prone and hard to refactor. Let‚Äôs encapsulate resource usage inside the res folder with safer objects. They look like the examples below: res/colors const colors = { title: &apos;#00B75D&apos;, text: &apos;#0C222B&apos;, button: &apos;#036675&apos; } export default colorsres/strings const strings = { onboarding: { welcome: { heading: &apos;Welcome&apos;, text1: &quot;What you don&apos;t know is what you haven&apos;t learn&quot;, text2: &apos;Visit my GitHub at [https://github.com/onmyway133&apos;](https://github.com/onmyway133&apos;), button: &apos;Log in&apos; }, term: { heading: &apos;Terms and conditions&apos;, button: &apos;Read&apos; } } } export default stringsres/fonts const fonts = { title: &apos;Arial&apos;, text: &apos;SanFrancisco&apos;, code: &apos;Fira&apos; } export default fontsres/images const images = { button: require(&apos;./images/button.png&apos;), logo: require(&apos;./images/logo.png&apos;), placeholder: require(&apos;./images/placeholder.png&apos;) } export default imagesLike library , res files can be access from anywhere, so let‚Äôs make it a module . Add package.json to the res folder: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;res&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.1&quot; }so we can access resource files like normal modules: import strings from &apos;res/strings&apos; import palette from &apos;res/palette&apos; import images from &apos;res/images&apos;Group colors, images, fonts with paletteThe design of the app should be consistent. Certain elements should have the same look and feel so they don‚Äôt confuse the user. For example, the heading Text should use one color, font, and font size. The Image component should use the same placeholder image. In React Native, we already use the name styles with const styles = StyleSheet.create({}) so let‚Äôs use the name palette. Below is my simple palette. It defines common styles for heading and Text: res/paletteimport colors from &apos;./colors&apos; const palette = { heading: { color: colors.title, fontSize: 20, textAlign: &apos;center&apos; }, text: { color: colors.text, fontSize: 17, textAlign: &apos;center&apos; } } export default paletteAnd then we can use them in our screen: const styles = StyleSheet.create({ container: { flex: 1, alignItems: &apos;center&apos; }, heading: {...palette.heading, ...{ marginTop: 72 }} })Here we use the object spread operator to merge palette.heading and our custom style object. This means that we use the styles from palette.heading but also specify more properties. If we were to reskin the app for multiple brands, we could have multiple palettes. This is a really powerful pattern. Generate imagesYou can see that in /src/res/images.js we have properties for each image in the src/res/images folder: const images = { button: require(&apos;./images/button.png&apos;), logo: require(&apos;./images/logo.png&apos;), placeholder: require(&apos;./images/placeholder.png&apos;) } export default imagesThis is tedious to do manually, and we have to update if there‚Äôs changes in image naming convention. Instead, we can add a script to generate the images.js based on the images we have. Add a file at the root of the project /scripts/images.js: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233const fs = require('fs')const imageFileNames = () =&gt; { const array = fs .readdirSync('src/res/images') .filter((file) =&gt; { return file.endsWith('.png') }) .map((file) =&gt; { return file.replace('[@2x](http://twitter.com/2x).png', '').replace('[@3x](http://twitter.com/3x).png', '') }) return Array.from(new Set(array))}const generate = () =&gt; { let properties = imageFileNames() .map((name) =&gt; { return `${name}: require('./images/${name}.png')` }) .join(',\\n ') const string = `const images = { ${properties} } export default images ` fs.writeFileSync('src/res/images.js', string, 'utf8')}generate() The cool thing about Node is that we have access to the fs module, which is really good at file processing. Here we simply traverse through images, and update /src/res/images.js accordingly. Whenever we add or change images, we can run: node scripts/images.jsAnd we can also declare the script inside our main package.json : &quot;scripts&quot;: { &quot;start&quot;: &quot;node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start&quot;, &quot;test&quot;: &quot;jest&quot;, &quot;lint&quot;: &quot;eslint *.js **/*.js&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: &quot;node scripts/images.js&quot; }Now we can just run npm run images and we get an up-to-date images.js resource file. How about custom fontsReact Native has some custom fonts that may be good enough for your projects. You can also use custom fonts. One thing to note is that Android uses the name of the font file, but iOS uses the full name. You can see the full name in Font Book app, or by inspecting in running app for (NSString* family in [UIFont familyNames]) { NSLog(@&quot;%@&quot;, family); for (NSString* name in [UIFont fontNamesForFamilyName: family]) { NSLog(@&quot;Family name: %@&quot;, name); } }For custom fonts to be registered in iOS, we need to declare UIAppFonts in Info.plist using the file name of the fonts, and for Android, the fonts need to be placed at app/src/main/assets/fonts . It is good practice to name the font file the same as full name. React Native is said to dynamically load custom fonts, but in case you get ‚ÄúUnrecognized font family‚Äù, then simply add those fonts to target within Xcode. Doing this by hand takes time, luckily we have rnpm that can help. First add all the fonts inside res/fonts folder. Then simply declare rnpm in package.json and run react-native link . This should declare UIAppFonts in iOS and move all the fonts into app/src/main/assets/fonts for Android. &quot;rnpm&quot;: { &quot;assets&quot;: [ &quot;./src/res/fonts/&quot; ] }Accessing fonts by name is error prone, we can create a script similar to what we have done with images to generate a safer accession. Add fonts.js to our scripts folder 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031const fs = require('fs')const fontFileNames = () =&gt; { const array = fs .readdirSync('src/res/fonts') .map((file) =&gt; { return file.replace('.ttf', '') }) return Array.from(new Set(array))}const generate = () =&gt; { const properties = fontFileNames() .map((name) =&gt; { const key = name.replace(/\\s/g, '') return `${key}: '${name}'` }) .join(',\\n ') const string = `const fonts = { ${properties} } export default fonts ` fs.writeFileSync('src/res/fonts.js', string, 'utf8')}generate() Now you can use custom font via R namespace. 1234567import R from 'res/R'const styles = StyleSheet.create({ text: { fontFamily: R.fonts.FireCodeNormal }}) The R namespaceThis step depends on personal taste, but I find it more organised if we introduce the R namespace, just like how Android does for assets with the generated R class. Once you externalize your app resources, you can access them using resource IDs that are generated in your project‚Äôs Rclass. This document shows you how to group your resources in your Android project and provide alternative resources for specific device configurations, and then access them from your app code or other XML files. This way, let‚Äôs make a file called R.js in src/res: import strings from &apos;./strings&apos; import images from &apos;./images&apos; import colors from &apos;./colors&apos; import palette from &apos;./palette&apos; const R = { strings, images, colors, palette } export default RAnd access it in the screen: 12345678910111213import R from 'res/R'render() { return ( &lt;SafeAreaView style={styles.container}&gt; &lt;Image style={styles.logo} source={R.images.logo} /&gt; &lt;Image style={styles.image} source={R.images.placeholder} /&gt; &lt;Text style={styles.title}&gt;{R.strings.onboarding.welcome.title.toUpperCase()}&lt;/Text&gt; )} Replace strings with R.strings, colors with R.colors, and images with R.images. With the R annotation, it is clear that we are accessing static assets from the app bundle. This also matches the Airbnb convention for singleton, as our R is now like a global constant. 23.8 Use PascalCase when you export a constructor / class / singleton / function library / bare object. const AirbnbStyleGuide = { es6: { }, } export default AirbnbStyleGuideWhere to go from hereIn this post, I‚Äôve shown you how I think you should structure folders and files in a React Native project.

From the early days, the ability to build and install custom plugins had given us a huge boost in productivity. It was not long before Apple introduced Xcode extension due to privacy concerns. I have built a few Xcode plugins and extensions like XcodeWay, XcodeColorSense, XcodeColorSense2, and Xmas. It was a rewarding experience. I learned a lot, and the productivity I gained was considerable. In this post I walkthrough how I converted my Xcode plugins to extensions, and the experience I had in doing so. My first Xcode plugin: XcodeWay I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it I really like the above quote from Bill Gates. I try to avoid repetitive and boring tasks. Whenever I find myself doing the same tasks again, I write scripts and tools to automate that. Doing this takes some time, but I will be a bit lazier in the near future. Besides the interest in building open source frameworks and tools, I like to extend the IDE I‚Äôm using ‚Äî mostly Xcode. I first started iOS development in 2014. I wanted a quick way to navigate to many places right from Xcode with the context of the current project. There are many times we want to: open the current project folder in ‚ÄúFinder‚Äù to change some files open Terminal to run some commands open the current file in GitHub to quickly give the link to a workmate or to open other folders like themes, plugins, code snippets, device logs. Every little bit of time we save each day counts. I thought it would be cool idea to write an Xcode plugin that we can do all above things right inside Xcode. Instead of waiting for other people to do it, I pulled up my sleeve and wrote my first Xcode plugin ‚Äî XcodeWay‚Äî and shared it as open source. XcodeWay works by creating a menu under Editor with lots of options to navigate to other places right from Xcode. It looks simple but there was some hard work required. What are Xcode plugins?Xcode plugins are not officially supported by Xcode or recommended by Apple. There are no documents about them. The best places we can learn about them are via existing plugins‚Äô source code and a few tutorials. An Xcode plugin is just a bundle of type xcplugin and is placed at ~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins . Xcode, when starting, will load any Xcode plugins present in this folder. Plugins are run in the same process as Xcode, so could do anything as Xcode. A bug in any plugin can cause Xcode to crash. To make an Xcode plugin, create a macOS Bundle with one class that extends from NSObject , and have an initialiser that accepts NSBundle , for example in Xmas: class Xmas: NSObject { var bundle: NSBundle init(bundle: NSBundle) { self.bundle = bundle super.init() } }Inside Info.plist, we need to: declare this class as the main entry class for the plugin, and that this bundle has no UI, because we create UI controls and add to the Xcode interface during runtime NSPrincipalClass Xmas XCPluginHasUI Another problem with Xcode plugins is that we have to continuously update DVTPluginCompatibilityUUIDs . This changes every time a new version of Xcode comes out. Without updating, Xcode will refuse to load the plugin. What Xcode plugins can doMany developers build Xcode plugins because they miss specific features found in other IDEs like Sublime Text, AppCode, or Atom. Since Xcode plugins are loaded in the same process as Xcode, they can do everything that Xcode can. The only limit is our imagination. We can leverage Objective C Runtime to discover private frameworks and functions. Then LLDB and Symbolic breakpoint can be used further to inspect running code and alter their behaviors. We can also use swizzling to change implementation of any running code. Writing Xcode plugins is hard ‚Äî lots of guessing, and sometimes a good knowledge of assembly is required. In the golden age of plugins, there was a popular plugin manager, which itself was a plugin, called Alcatraz. It could install other plugins, which basically just downloads the xcplugin file and moves this to the Plug Ins folder. To get a sense of what plugins can do, let‚Äôs take a look at some popular plugins. XvimFirst in the list is Xvim, which adds Vim keybindings right inside Xcode. It supports mostly all of the keybindings that we used to have in Terminal. SCXcodeMiniMapIf you miss MiniMap mode in Sublime Text, you can use SCXcodeMiniMap to add a right map panel inside Xcode editor. FuzzyAutocompletePluginBefore version 9, Xcode didn‚Äôt have proper auto completion ‚Äî it was just based on prefix. That was where FuzzyAutocompletePlugin shone. It performs fuzzy auto completion based on the hidden IDEOpenQuicklyPattern feature in Xcode. KSImageNamed-XcodeTo display a bundle image inside UIImageView, we often use the imageNamed method. But remembering exactly the name of the image file is hard. KSImageNamed-Xcode is here to help. You will get a list of auto-suggested image names when you begin to type. ColorSense-for-XcodeAnother itch during development is to work with UIColor , which uses RGBA color space. We don‚Äôt get a visual indicator of the color that we specify, and manually performing checking can be time consuming. Luckily there is ColorSense-for-Xcode which shows the color being used and the color picker panel to easily select the right color. LinkedConsoleIn AppCode, we can jump to a specific line in the file that is logged inside the console. If you miss this feature in Xcode, you can use LinkedConsole. This enables clickable links inside Xcode console so we can jump to that file instantly. The hard work behind Xcode pluginsMaking an Xcode plugin is not easy. Not only do we need to know macOS programming, but we also need to dive deep into Xcode view hierarchy. We need to explore private frameworks and APIs in order to inject the feature we want. There are very few tutorials on how to make plugins but, luckily, most plugins are open source so we can understand how they work. Since I have made a few plugins, I can give some technical details about them. Xcode plugins are done usually with two private frameworks: DVTKit and IDEKit . System frameworks are at /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks but the frameworks that Xcode uses exclusively are under /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/ , there you can find Frameworks , OtherFrameworks and SharedFrameworks. There is a tool class-dump that can generate headers from the Xcode app bundle. With the class names and methods, you can call NSClassFromString to get the class from the name. Swizzling DVTBezelAlertPanel framework in XmasChristmas has always given me a special feeling, so I decided to make Xmas, which shows a random Christmas picture instead of the default alert view. The class used to render that view is DVTBezelAlertPanel inside the DVTKit framework. My article on building that plugin is here. With Objective C Runtime, there is a technique called swizzling, which can change and switch implementation and method signature of any running classes and methods. Here, in order to change the content of that alert view, we need to swap the initialiser initWithIcon:message:parentWindow:duration: with our own method. We do that early by listening to NSApplicationDidFinishLaunchingNotification which is notified when a macOS plugin, in this case Xcode, launches. class func swizzleMethods() { guard let originalClass = NSClassFromString(&quot;DVTBezelAlertPanel&quot;) as? NSObject.Type else { return } do { try originalClass.jr_swizzleMethod(&quot;initWithIcon:message:parentWindow:duration:&quot;, withMethod: &quot;xmas_initWithIcon:message:parentWindow:duration:&quot;) } catch { Swift.print(&quot;Swizzling failed&quot;) } }I initially liked to do everything in Swift. But it‚Äôs tricky to use the swizzle init method in Swift, so the quickest way is to do that in Objective C. Then we simply traverse the view hierarchy to find the NSVisualEffectView inside NSPanel to update the image. Interacting with DVTSourceTextView in XcodeColorSenseI work mostly with hex colors and I want a quick way to see the color. So I built XcodeColorSense ‚Äî it supports hex color, RGBA, and named color. The idea is simple. Parse the string to see if the user is typing something related to UIColor, and show a small overlay view with that color as background. The text view that Xcode uses is of type DVTSourceTextView in DVTKit framework. We also need to listen to NSTextViewDidChangeSelectionNotification which is triggered whenever any NSTextView content is changed. func listenNotification() { NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: #selector(handleSelectionChange(_:)), name: NSTextViewDidChangeSelectionNotification, object: nil) } func handleSelectionChange(note: NSNotification) { guard let DVTSourceTextView = NSClassFromString(&quot;DVTSourceTextView&quot;) as? NSObject.Type, object = note.object where object.isKindOfClass(DVTSourceTextView.self), let textView = object as? NSTextView else { return } self.textView = textView }I had a Matcher architecture so we can detect different kinds of UIColor constructions ‚Äî for example HexMatcher . public struct HexMatcher: Matcher { func check(line: String, selectedText: String) -&gt; (color: NSColor, range: NSRange)? { let pattern1 = &quot;\\&quot;#?[A-Fa-f0-9]{6}\\&quot;&quot; let pattern2 = &quot;0x[A-Fa-f0-9]{6}&quot; let ranges = [pattern1, pattern2].flatMap { return Regex.check(line, pattern: $0) } guard let range = ranges.first else { return nil } let text = (line as NSString).substringWithRange(range).replace(&quot;0x&quot;, with: &quot;&quot;).replace(&quot;\\&quot;&quot;, with: &quot;&quot;) let color = NSColor.hex(text) return (color: color, range: range) } }To render the overlay, we use NSColorWell which is good for showing a view with background. The position is determined by calling firstRectForCharacterRange and some point conversions with convertRectFromScreen and convertRect . Using NSTask and IDEWorkspaceWindowController in XcodeWayFinally, my beloved XcodeWay. I found myself needing to go to different places from Xcode with the context of the current project. So I built XcodeWay as a plugin that adds lots of handy menu options under Window. Since the plugin runs in the same Xcode process, it has access to the main menu NSApp.mainMenu?.itemWithTitle(‚ÄúWindow‚Äù) . There we can alter the menu. XcodeWay is designed to easily extend functionalities through its Navigator protocol. [@objc](http://twitter.com/objc) protocol Navigator: NSObjectProtocol { func navigate() var title: String { get } }For folders with a static path like Provisioning Profile ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles or User data Developer/Xcode/UserData , we can just construct the URL and call NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace().openURL . For dynamic folders that vary depending on the current project, more work needs to be done. How do we open the folder for the current project in Finder? The information for the current project path is kept inside IDEWorkspaceWindowController . This is a class that manages workspace windows in Xcode. Take a look at EnvironmentManager where we use objc_getClass to get the class definition from a string. self.IDEWorkspaceWindowControllerClass = objc_getClass(&quot;IDEWorkspaceWindowController&quot;); NSArray *workspaceWindowControllers = [self.IDEWorkspaceWindowControllerClass valueForKey:@&quot;workspaceWindowControllers&quot;]; id workSpace = nil; for (id controller in workspaceWindowControllers) { if ([[controller valueForKey:@&quot;window&quot;] isEqual:[NSApp keyWindow]]) { workSpace = [controller valueForKey:@&quot;_workspace&quot;]; } } NSString * path = [[workSpace valueForKey:@&quot;representingFilePath&quot;] valueForKey:@&quot;_pathString&quot;];Finally, we can utilise valueForKey to get the value for any property that we think exists. This way not only do we get the project path, we also get the path to the opening file. So we can call activateFileViewerSelectingURLs on NSWorkspace to open Finder with that file selected. This is handy as users don‚Äôt need to look for that file in Finder. Many times we want to execute some Terminal commands on the current project folder. To achieve that, we can use NSTask with launch pad /usr/bin/open and arguments [@‚Äù-a‚Äù, @‚ÄùTerminal‚Äù, projectFolderPath] . iTerm, if configured probably, will open this in a new tab. The documents for iOS 7 apps are placed in the fixed location iPhone Simulator inside Application Support. But, from iOS 8, every app has a unique UUID and their document folders are hard to predict. ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/1A2FF360-B0A6-8127-95F3-68A6AB0BCC78/data/Container/Data/Application/We can build a map and perform tracking to find the generated ID for the current project, or to check the plist inside each folder to compare the bundle identifier. The quick solution that I came up with was to search for the most recent updated folder. Every time we build the project, or make changes inside the app, their document folder is updated. That is where we can make use of NSFileModificationDate to find the folder for the current project. There are many hacks when working with Xcode plugins, but the results are rewarding. Every few minutes we save each day end up saving a lot of time overall. Security and freedomWith great power comes great responsibility. The fact that plugins can do whatever they want rings an alert to security. In late 2015, there was a malware attack by distributing a modified version of Xcode, called XcodeGhost, which injects malicious code into any apps built with Xcode Ghost. The malware is believed to use the plugin mechanism among other things. Like the iOS apps we download from the Appstore, macOS apps like Xcode are signed by Apple when we download them from the Mac Appstore or through official Apple download links. Code signing your app assures users that it is from a known source and the app hasn‚Äôt been modified since it was last signed. Before your app can integrate app services, be installed on a device, or be submitted to the App Store, it must be signed with a certificate issued by Apple To avoid potential malware like this, at WWDC 2016 Apple announced the Xcode Source Editor Extension as the only way to load third party extensions into Xcode. This means that, from Xcode 8, plugins can‚Äôt be loaded. Source Editor ExtensionExtension is the recommended approach to safely add functionalities in restricted ways. App extensions give users access to your app‚Äôs functionality and content throughout iOS and macOS. For example, your app can now appear as a widget on the Today screen, add new buttons in the Action sheet, offer photo filters within the Photos app, or display a new system-wide custom keyboard. For now, the only extension to Xcode is Source Editor, which allows us to read and modify contents of a source file, as well as read and modify the current text selection within the editor. Extension is a new target and runs in a different process than Xcode. This is good in that it can‚Äôt alter Xcode in any ways other than conforming to XCSourceEditorCommand to modify the current document content. protocol XCSourceEditorCommand { func perform(with invocation: [XCSourceEditorCommandInvocation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcodekit/xcsourceeditorcommandinvocation), completionHandler: @escaping ([Error](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/error)?) -&gt; [Void](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/void)) } Xcode 8 has lots of improvements like the new code completion features, Swift image and color literals, and snippets. This led to the deprecation of many Xcode plugins. For some indispensable plugins like XVim, this is unbearable for some people. Some old plugin features can‚Äôt be achieved with the current Source Editor Extension system. Unless you resign XcodeA workaround to bypass the restriction from Xcode 8 for plugins, is to replace the existing Xcode signature by a technique called resign. Resigning is very easy ‚Äî we just need to create a self-signed certificate and call the codesign command. After this, Xcode should be able to load plugins. codesign -f -s MySelfSignedCertificate /Applications/Xcode.appIt is, however, not possible to submit apps built with resigned Xcode as the signature does not match the official version of Xcode. One way is to use two Xcodes: one official for distribution and one resigned for development. Moving to Xcode extensionXcode extension is the way to go, so I started moving my plugins to extension. For Xmas, since it modifies view hierarchy, it can‚Äôt become an extension. Color literal in XcodeColorSense2For the color sense, I rewrote the extension from scratch, and called it XcodeColorSense2. This, of course, can‚Äôt show an overlay over the current editor view. So I chose to utilize the new Color literal found in Xcode 8+. The color is shown in a small box. It may be hard to distinguish similar colors, so that‚Äôs why I also include the name. The code is simply about inspecting selections and parsing to find the color declaration. func perform(with invocation: XCSourceEditorCommandInvocation, completionHandler: [@escaping](http://twitter.com/escaping) (Error?) -&gt; Void ) -&gt; Void { guard let selection = invocation.buffer.selections.firstObject as? XCSourceTextRange else { completionHandler(nil) return } let lineNumber = selection.start.line guard lineNumber &lt; invocation.buffer.lines.count, let line = invocation.buffer.lines[lineNumber] as? String else { completionHandler(nil) return } guard let hex = findHex(string: line) else { completionHandler(nil) return } let newLine = process(line: line, hex: hex) invocation.buffer.lines.replaceObject(at: lineNumber, with: newLine) completionHandler(nil) } }Most of the functionality is embedded inside my framework Farge, but I can‚Äôt find a way to use the framework inside Xcode extension. Since the extension feature is only accessible through the Editor menu, we can customise a key binding to invoke this menu item. For example I choose Cmd+Ctrl+S to show and hide color information. This is, of course, not intuitive compared to the original plugin, but it‚Äôs better than nothing. How to debug Xcode extensionsWorking and debugging extensions is straightforward. We can use Xcode to debug Xcode. The debugged version of Xcode has a gray icon. How to install Xcode extensionsThe extension must have an accompanying macOS app. This can be distributed to Mac Appstore or self-signed. I‚Äôve written an article on how to do this. All extensions for an app need to be explicitly enabled through ‚ÄúSystem Preferences‚Äù. The Xcode extension only works with editor for now, so we must open a source file for the Editor menu to have effect. AppleScript in XcodeWayIn Xcode extensions, NSWorkspace, NSTask and private class construction don‚Äôt work anymore. Since I have used Finder Sync Extension in FinderGo, I thought I could try the same AppleScript scripting for Xcode extension. AppleScript is a scripting language created by Apple. It allows users to directly control scriptable Macintosh applications, as well as parts of macOS itself. You can create scripts ‚Äî sets of written instructions ‚Äî to automate repetitive tasks, combine features from multiple scriptable applications, and create complex workflows. To try AppleScript, you can use the app Script Editor built inside macOS to write prototype functions. Function declaration starts with on and ends with end . To avoid potential conflicts with system functions, I usually use my as a prefix. Here is how I rely on System Events to get the home directory. User interface scripting terminology is found in the ‚ÄúProcesses Suite‚Äù of the ‚ÄúSystem Events‚Äù scripting dictionary. This suite includes terminology for interacting with most types of user interface elements, including: windows buttons checkboxes menus radio buttons text fields. In System Events, the process class represents a running app. Many good citizen apps support AppleScript by exposing some of their functionalities, so these can be used by other apps. Here is how I get the current song from Spotify in Lyrics. tell application &quot;Spotify&quot; set trackId to id of current track as string set trackName to name of current track as string set artworkUrl to artwork url of current track as string set artistName to artist of current track as string set albumName to album of current track as string return trackId &amp; &quot;---&quot; &amp; trackName &amp; &quot;---&quot; &amp; artworkUrl &amp; &quot;---&quot; &amp; artistName &amp; &quot;---&quot; &amp; albumName end tellTo get all the possible commands of a certain app, we can open the dictionary in Script Editor. There we can learn about which functions and parameters are supported. If you think Objective C is hard, AppleScript is much harder. The syntax is verbose and error-prone. For your reference, here is the whole script file that powers XcodeWay. To open a certain folder, tell Finder using POSIX file. I refactor every functionality into function for better code reuse. on myOpenFolder(myPath) tell application &quot;Finder&quot; activate open myPath as POSIX file end tell end myOpenFolderThen, to run AppleScript inside a macOS app or extension, we need to construct an AppleScript descriptor with the correct process serial number and event identifiers. func eventDescriptior(functionName: String) -&gt; NSAppleEventDescriptor { var psn = ProcessSerialNumber(highLongOfPSN: 0, lowLongOfPSN: UInt32(kCurrentProcess)) let target = NSAppleEventDescriptor( descriptorType: typeProcessSerialNumber, bytes: &amp;psn, length: MemoryLayout&lt;ProcessSerialNumber&gt;.size ) let event = NSAppleEventDescriptor( eventClass: UInt32(kASAppleScriptSuite), eventID: UInt32(kASSubroutineEvent), targetDescriptor: target, returnID: Int16(kAutoGenerateReturnID), transactionID: Int32(kAnyTransactionID) ) let function = NSAppleEventDescriptor(string: functionName) event.setParam(function, forKeyword: AEKeyword(keyASSubroutineName)) return event }Other tasks, like checking the current Git remote, are a bit trickier. Many times I want to share the link of the file I‚Äôm debugging to my remote teammate, so they know what file I‚Äôm referencing. This is doable by using shell script inside AppleScript . on myGitHubURL() set myPath to myProjectPath() set myConsoleOutput to (do shell script &quot;cd &quot; &amp; quoted form of myPath &amp; &quot;; git remote -v&quot;) set myRemote to myGetRemote(myConsoleOutput) set myUrl to (do shell script &quot;cd &quot; &amp; quoted form of myPath &amp; &quot;; git config --get remote.&quot; &amp; quoted form of myRemote &amp; &quot;.url&quot;) set myUrlWithOutDotGit to myRemoveSubString(myUrl, &quot;.git&quot;) end myGitHubURLWe can use quoted and string concatenation to form strings. Luckily we can expose Foundation framework and certain classes. Here is how I expose NSString to take advantage of all existing functionalities. Writing string manipulation from scratch using plain AppleScript will take lots of time. use scripting additions use framework &quot;Foundation&quot; property NSString : a reference to current application&apos;s NSStringWith this we can build our other functions for string handling. on myRemoveLastPath(myPath) set myString to NSString&apos;s stringWithString:myPath set removedLastPathString to myString&apos;s stringByDeletingLastPathComponent removedLastPathString as text end myRemoveLastPathOne cool feature that XcodeWay supports is the ability to go to the document directory for the current app in the simulator. This is handy when we need to inspect a document to check saved or cached data. The directory is dynamic so it‚Äôs hard to detect. We can, however, sort the directory for the most recently updated. Below is how we chain multiple shell scripts commands to find the folder. on myOpenDocument() set command1 to &quot;cd ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/;&quot; set command2 to &quot;cd `ls -t | head -n 1`/data/Containers/Data/Application;&quot; set command3 to &quot;cd `ls -t | head -n 1`/Documents;&quot; set command4 to &quot;open .&quot; do shell script command1 &amp; command2 &amp; command3 &amp; command4 end myOpenDocumentThis feature helped me a lot when developing Gallery to check whether videos and downloaded images are saved in the correct place. However, none of the scripts seem to work. Scripting has always been part of macOS since 1993. But, with the advent of the Mac Appstore and security concerns, AppleScript finally got restricted in mid 2012. That was when App Sandbox was enforced. App SandboxApp Sandbox is an access control technology provided in macOS, enforced at the kernel level. It is designed to contain damage to the system and the user‚Äôs data if an app becomes compromised. Apps distributed through the Mac App Store must adopt App Sandbox. For an Xcode extension to be loaded by Xcode, it must also support App Sandbox. At the beginning of App Sandbox enforcement, we could use App Sandbox Temporary Exception to temporarily grant our app access to Apple Script. This is now not possible. The only way for AppleScript to run is if it resides inside ~/Library/Application Scripts folder. How to install custom scriptsmacOS apps or extensions can‚Äôt just install scripts into the Application Scripts by themselves. They need user consent. One possible way to do that is to enable Read/Write and show a dialog using NSOpenPanel to ask user to select the folder to install our scripts. For XcodeWay, I choose to provide an install shell script so the user has a quick way to install scripts. #!/bin/bash set -euo pipefail DOWNLOAD_URL=[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onmyway133/XcodeWay/master/XcodeWayExtensions/Script/XcodeWayScript.scpt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onmyway133/XcodeWay/master/XcodeWayExtensions/Script/XcodeWayScript.scpt) SCRIPT_DIR=&quot;${HOME}/Library/Application Scripts/com.fantageek.XcodeWayApp.XcodeWayExtensions&quot; mkdir -p &quot;${SCRIPT_DIR}&quot; curl $DOWNLOAD_URL -o &quot;${SCRIPT_DIR}/XcodeWayScript.scpt&quot;AppleScript is very powerful. All of this is made explicit so the user has complete control over which things can be done. Like an extension, a script is done asynchronously in a different process using XPC for inter process communication. This enhances security as a script has no access to the address space to our app or extension. More security in macOS MojaveThis year, at WWDC 2018, Apple introduced macOS Mojave which focuses on lots of security enhancements. In the Your Apps and the Future of macOS Security we can learn more about new security requirement for macOS apps. One of them is the usage description for AppleEvents. unable to load info.plist exceptions (egpu overrides) We used to declare usage description for many permissions in iOS, like photo library, camera, and push notifications. Now we need to declare the usage description for AppleEvents. Source: https://www.felix-schwarz.org/blog/2018/08/new-apple-event-apis-in-macos-mojave The first time our extension tries to execute some AppleScript commands, the above dialog is shown to ask for user consent. User can grant or deny permission, but for Xcode please say yes üôè The fix for us is to declare NSAppleEventsUsageDescription in our app target. We only need to declare in the app target, not in the extension target. &lt;key&gt;NSAppleEventsUsageDescription&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;Use AppleScript to open folders&lt;/string&gt;Where to go from hereHuff huff, whew! Thanks for following such a long journey. Making frameworks and tools take lots of time, especially plugins and extensions ‚Äî we have to continuously change to adapt them to new operating systems and security requirements. But it is a rewarding process, as we‚Äôve learned more and have some tools to save our precious time. For your reference, here are my extensions which are fully open source. XcodeWay XcodeColorSense2 I hope you find something useful in the post. Here are some resources to help explore Xcode extensions further: Xcode Plugins by NSHipster Writing Xcode plugin in Swift Xcode 8 Plugins (Alcatraz) ‚Äî The end of an era Using and Extending the Xcode Source Editor Why do I need to resign Xcode to use XVim2","link":"/blog/How-to-convert-your-Xcode-plugins-to-Xcode-extensions/"},{"title":"URL Routing with Compass","text":"Issue #110 Medium version https://medium.com/@onmyway133/url-routing-with-compass-d59c0061e7e2 Apps often have many screens, and UIViewController works well as the basis for a screen, together with presentation and navigation APIs. Things are fine until you get lost in the forest of flows, and code becomes hard to maintain. One way to avoid this is the central URL routing approach. Think of it as a network router that handles and resolves all routing requests. This way, the code becomes declarative and decoupled, so that the list component does not need to know what it‚Äôs presenting. URL routing also makes logging and tracking easy along with ease of handling external requests such as deep linking. There are various frameworks that perform URL routing. In this tutorial you‚Äôll use Compass for its simplicity. You‚Äôll refactor an existing app, which is a simplified Instagram app named PhotoFeed. When you‚Äôve finished this tutorial, you‚Äôll know how to declare and use routers with Compass and handle deep linking. Getting StartedDownload the starter project and unzip it. Go to the PhotoFeed folder and run pod install to install the particular dependencies for this project. Open PhotoFeed.xcworkspace and run the project. Tap Login to go to the Instagram login page and enter your Instagram credentials, then have a look around the app. The main app is made of a UITabBarController that shows the feed, the currently logged-in user profile and a menu. This is a typical Model View Controller project where UIViewController handles Cell delegates and takes responsibility for the navigation. For simplicity, all view controllers inherit from TableController and CollectionController that know how to manage list of a particular model and cell. All models conform to the new Swift 4 Codable protocol. Registering Your App on InstagramIn order to use the Instagram API, you‚Äôll need to register your app at Instagram Developer. After obtaining your client id, switch back to the project. Go to APIClient.swift and modify your clientId. Note: The project comes with a default app with limited permissions. The app can‚Äôt access following or follower APIs, and you can only see your own posts and comments Compass 101The concept of Compass is very simple: you have a set of routes and central place for handling these routes. Think of a route as a navigation request to a specific screen within the app. The idea behind URL routing is borrowed from the modern web server. When user enters a URL into the browser, such as https://flawlessapp.io/category/ios, that request is sent from the browser to the web server. The server parses the URL and returns the requested content, such as HTML or JSON. Most web server frameworks have URL routing support, including ASP.NET, Express.js, and others. For example, here is how you handle a URL route in express.js: 1234app.get('/api/category/:categoryTag', function (req, res) { const page = getCategoryPageFor(req.params.categoryTag) res.send(page)}) Users or apps request a specific URL that express an intent about what should be returned or displayed. But instead of returning web pages, Compass constructs screens in terms of UIViewController and presents them. Route PatternsThis is how you declare a routing schema in Compass: 1Navigator.routes = [\"profile:{userId}\", \"post:{postId}\", \"logout\"] This is simply as array of patterns you register on the Navigator. This is the central place where you define all your routes. Since they are in one place, all your navigations are kept in one place and can easily be understood. Looking at the example above, {userId}, {postId} are placeholders that will be resolved to actual parameters. For example with post:BYOkwgXnwr3, you get userId of BYOkwgXnwr3. Compass also performs pattern matching, in that post:BYOkwgXnwr3 matches post:{postId}, not comment:{postId}, blogpost:{postId}, ‚Ä¶This will become to make sense in following sections. The NavigatorThe Navigator is a the central place for routes registration, navigating and handling. The next step is to trigger a routing request. You can do that via the Navigator. For example, this is how you do in the feed to request opening a specific post: 1Navigator.navigate(urn: \"post:BYOkwgXnwr3\") Compass uses the user-friendly urn, short for Uniform Resource Name to make itwork seamlessly with Deep Linking. This urn matches the routing schema post:{postId}. Compass uses {param} as the special token to identifier the parameter and : as the delimiter. You can change the delimiter to something else by configuring Navigator.delimiter. You have learned how to register routes and navigate in Compass. Next, you will learn how to customize the handling code to your need. LocationNavigator parses and works with Location under the hood. Given the URN of post:BYOkwgXnwr3, you get a Location where path is the route pattern, and arguments contain the resolved parameters. 1234path = \"post:{postId}\"arguments = [ \"postId\": \"BYOkwgXnwr3\"] To actually perform the navigation, you assign a closure that takes a Location to Navigator.handle. 123456789101112131415Navigator.handle = { [weak self] location in guard let `self` = self else { return } let arguments = location.arguments switch location.path { case \"post:{postId}\": let postController = PostController(postId: postID) self.rootController.pushViewController(postController, animated: true) default: break }} The letself= self dance is to ensure self isn‚Äôt released by the time this closure is executed. If it is released, the routing it‚Äôs about to perform is likely invalid, and you return without doing anything instead. You should typically do the above in the components that own the root controller, such as AppDelegate as seen above. That‚Äôs the basic of Compass. Astute readers may have noticed that it does not scale, as the number of switch statements will grow as the number of routes and endpoints increase in your app. This is where the Routable protocol comes in. Anything conforming to Routable knows how to handle a specific route. Apps may have many modular sections, and each section may have a set of routes. Compass handles these scenario by using a composite Routable named Router that groups them . You can have a router for a pre-login module, a post-login module, premium features module, and so on. In the next section, you‚Äôll change PhotoFeed to use Router and Routable. Router to the RescueThe first step is to include Compass in your project. Using CocoaPods, this is an easy task. Edit the Podfile with the project and type pod 'Compass', '~&gt; 5.0' just before the end statement. Then open Terminal and execute the following: 1pod install The version of Compass used in this tutorial is 5.1.0. Registering a Router To start, you‚Äôll create a simple router to handle all post-login routes. Open AppDelegate.swift, and import Compass at the top of the file: 1import Compass Next, add the following router declaration under the var mainController: MainController? declaration: 1var postLoginRouter = Router() Then declare a function called setupRouting, you ‚Äòll do this in an extension to separate the routing setup from the main code in AppDelegate. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526extension AppDelegate { func setupRouting() { // [1] Register scheme Navigator.scheme = \"photofeed\" // [2] Configure routes for Router postLoginRouter.routes = [:] // [3] Register routes you 'd like to support Navigator.routes = Array(postLoginRouter.routes.keys) // [4] Do the handling Navigator.handle = { [weak self] location in guard let selectedController = self?.mainController?.selectedViewController else { return } // [5] Choose the current visible controller let currentController = (selectedController as? UINavigationController)?.topViewController ?? selectedController // [6] Navigate self?.postLoginRouter.navigate(to: location, from: currentController) } }} Here‚Äôs what you do in the above method: Declare a scheme for Compass to work. This is your application URL scheme. This shines when you wish to support deep linking . Register all the routes in your app. Router accepts a mapping of route and Routable conformers. This is empty for now, but you will add several routes in a moment. A Navigator can manage multiple routers. In this case, you only register one router. This is where you supply the handling closure. Navigator uses this to handle a resolved location request. Screens in one modular section originate from one root or parent view controller. In order to show something from the route, you should try to push or present it from the selected most-visible view controller. In this project, the root is a UITabBarController, so you try to get the top controller from the current selected navigation. The selection of current controller depends on the module and your app use cases, so Compass let you decide it. If you use the side menu drawer, then you can just change the selected view controller. Finally, since Router is a composite Routable, you dispatch to it the Location. Finally, you need to call this newly added function. Add the following line right above window?.makeKeyAndVisible(): 1setupRouting() Build and run. Nothing seems to work yet! To make things happen, you‚Äôll need to add all the route handlers. You‚Äôll do this in the next section. Implementing the Route HandlersFirst, create a new file and name it Routers.swift. This is where you‚Äôll declare all of your route handlers. At the beginning of the file, add import Compass. Compass declares a simple protocol ‚Äî Routable ‚Äî that decides what to do with a given Location request from a Current Controller. If a request can‚Äôt be handled, it will throw with RouteError. Its implementation looks like this: 123public protocol Routable { func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws} It‚Äôs an incredibly simple protocol. Any routes you create only need to implement that single method. Now create your first handler to deal with user info request. 12345678910111213struct UserRoute: Routable { func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws { // [1] Examine arguments guard let userId = location.arguments[\"userId\"] else { return } // [2] Create the controller let controller = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"UserController\") as! UserController controller.userId = userId currentController.navigationController?.pushViewController(controller, animated: true) }} This is called when you touch the post author on the feed. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening: UserRoute deals with user:{userId} urn, so location.arguments[&quot;userId&quot;] should contain the correct userId to inject into UserController. This app uses storyboards to make the UI, so get the correct view controller based on its identifier. Remember tha currentController is the current visible controller in the navigation stack. So you ask for its UINavigationController to push a new view controller. Right below this router, add one more route for the screen shown when the user wants to see who likes a particular post: 1234567891011struct LikesRoute: Routable { func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws { guard let mediaId = location.arguments[\"mediaId\"] else { return } let controller = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"LikesController\") as! LikesController controller.mediaId = mediaId currentController.navigationController?.pushViewController(controller, animated: true) }} The remaining RouteNow it‚Äôs your turn to write the other route handlers: CommentsRoute, FollowingRoute, FollowerRoute. See if you can figure it out first, you can find the solution below. Here‚Äôs what you should have: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435struct CommentsRoute: Routable { func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws { guard let mediaId = location.arguments[\"mediaId\"] else { return } let controller = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"CommentsController\") as! CommentsController controller.mediaId = mediaId currentController.navigationController?.pushViewController(controller, animated: true) }}struct FollowingRoute: Routable { func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws { guard let userId = location.arguments[\"userId\"] else { return } let controller = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"FollowingController\") as! FollowingController controller.userId = userId currentController.navigationController?.pushViewController(controller, animated: true) }}struct FollowerRoute: Routable { func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws { guard let userId = location.arguments[\"userId\"] else { return } let controller = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"FollowerController\") as! FollowerController controller.userId = userId currentController.navigationController?.pushViewController(controller, animated: true) }} The LogoutRouteThere is one more route to add: the one you‚Äôll use for logout. LogoutRoute is quite tricky, as it usually involves changing the current root view controller. Who knows this better than the app delegate? Open AppDelegate.swift and add the following code at the very bottom: 123456struct LogoutRoute: Routable { func navigate(to location: Location, from currentController: CurrentController) throws { APIClient.shared.accessToken = nil (UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).showLogin() }} Now that you‚Äôve implemented all of the route handlers, you will have to tell Navigator which route is used for which URN. Still in AppDelegate.swift, find postLoginRouter.routes = [:] and replace it with the following: 12345678postLoginRouter.routes = [ \"user:{userId}\": UserRoute(), \"comments:{mediaId}\": CommentsRoute(), \"likes:{mediaId}\": LikesRoute(), \"following:{userId}\": FollowingRoute(), \"follower:{userId}\": FollowerRoute(), \"logout\": LogoutRoute()] Build the app and everything should compile. Now all that‚Äôs left is to actually all all of the code you‚Äôve written! Refactoring TimeIt‚Äôs time to refactor all the code in UIViewController by replacing all the navigation code with your new routing instructions. Start by freeing the FeedController from the unnecessary tasks of navigation. Open FeedController.swift and add the following import to the top of the file: 1import Compass Next, look for // MARK: - MediaCellDelegate and replace the three MediaCell delegate methods with the following: 1234567891011func mediaCell(_ cell: MediaCell, didViewLikes mediaId: String) { try? Navigator.navigate(urn: \"likes:\\(mediaId)\")}func mediaCell(_ cell: MediaCell, didViewComments mediaId: String) { try? Navigator.navigate(urn: \"comments:\\(mediaId)\")}func mediaCell(_ cell: MediaCell, didSelectUserName userId: String) { try? Navigator.navigate(urn: \"user:\\(userId)\")} For these three cases, you simply want to navigate to another screen. Therefore, all you need to do is tell the Navigator where you want to go. For simplicity, you use try? to deal with any code that throws. Build and run the app. Search for your favorite post in the feed, and tap on the author, the post comments or likes to go to the target screen. The app behaves the same as it did before, but the code is now clean and declarative. Now do the same with UserController.swift. Add the following import to the top of the file: 1import Compass Replace the code after // MARK: - UserViewDelegate with the following: 1234567func userView(_ view: UserView, didViewFollower userId: String) { try? Navigator.navigate(urn: \"follower:\\(userId)\")}func userView(_ view: UserView, didViewFollowing userId: String) { try? Navigator.navigate(urn: \"following:\\(userId)\")} Your task now is to refactor with the last route LogoutRoute. Open MenuController.swift and add the following to the top: 1import Compass Remove the logout method altogether. Find the following: indexPath.section 12 logout()} ‚Ä¶and replace it with: 123if indexPath.section == Section.account.rawValue, indexPath.row == 0 { try? Navigator.navigate(urn: \"logout\")} Build and run the app, navigate to the menu and tap Logout. You should be taken to the login screen. Handling Deep LinkingDeep linking allows your apps to be opened via a predefined URN. The system identifies each app via its URL scheme. For web pages, the scheme is usually http, https. For Instagram it is, quite handily, instagram. Use cases for this are inter-app navigation and app advertisements. For examples, the Messenger app uses this to open the user profile in the Facebook app, and Twitter uses this to open the App Store to install another app from an advertisement. In order for user to be redirected back to PhotoFeed, you need to specify a custom URL scheme for your app. Remember where you declared Navigator.scheme = &quot;photofeed&quot;? PhotoFeed just so happens to conform to this URL scheme, so deep links already worked ‚Äî and you didn‚Äôt even know it! Build and run the app, then switch to Safari. Type photofeed:// in the address bar, then tap Go. That will trigger your app to open. The app opens, but PhotoFeed doesn‚Äôt parse any parameters in the URL to go anywhere useful. Time to change that! Your app responds to the URL scheme opening by implementing a UIApplicationDelegate method. Add the following after setupRouting in AppDelegate.swift: 1234func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -&gt; Bool { try? Navigator.navigate(url: url) return true} Navigator parses and handles this for you. Build and run again. Go to Safari app, type photofeed://user:self and tap Go. Photofeed will open and show the currently logged in users‚Äô profile. Because you already had UserRoute, the requested URL was handled gracefully. Your app may already be presenting a particular screen when a routing request comes, but you‚Äôve anticipated this by resetting the navigation controller or presentation stack to show the requested screen. This simple solution works for most cases. Again, it‚Äôs recommended you pick the topmost visible view controller as the current controller in Navigator.handle. Deep linking is usually considered external navigation, in that the routing requests come from outside your app. Thanks to the central routing system that you developed, the code to handle external and internal routing requests is very much the same and involves no code duplication at all. Routing with Push NotificationsPush notifications help engage users with your app. You may have received messages like ‚ÄúHey, checkout today ‚Äòs most popular stories‚Äù on Medium, ‚ÄúYour friend has a birthday today‚Äù on Facebook, ‚Ä¶ and when you tap those banners, you are taken straight to that particular screen. How cool is that? This is achievable with your URL routing approach. Imagine users tapping a push notification banner saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a celebrity on PhotoFeed ‚Äî check out your profile now!‚Äù and being sent directly to their profile screen. To accomplish this, you simply have to embed the URN info into the push payload and handle that in your app. Setting upTo start, you‚Äôll need to specify your bundle ID. Go to Target Settings\\General to change your bundle ID as push notification requires a unique bundle ID to work. Your project uses com.fantageek.PhotoFeed by default. Next, you‚Äôll need to register your App ID. Go to Member Center and register your App ID. Remember your Team ID, as you will need it in the final step. Also tick the Push Notification checkbox under Application Services. Now you‚Äôll need to generate your Authentication Key. Apple provides Token Authentication as a new authentication mechanism for push notifications. The token is easy to generate, works for all your apps, and mostly, it never expires. Still in Member Center, create a new Key and download it as a .p8 file. Remember your Key ID as you will need it in the final step. Next up: enabling push notification capability. Back in Xcode, go to Target Settings\\Capabilities and enable Push Notifications, which will add PhotoFeed.entitlements to your project. The next step is to register for push notifications. Open MainController.swift and add the following import to the top of MainController.swift: 1import UserNotifications You want to enable push notification only after login, so MainController is the perfect place. UserNotifications is recommended for app targeting iOS 10 and above. 123456789101112override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // [1] Register to get device token for remote notifications UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications() // [2] Register to handle push notification UI let options: UNAuthorizationOptions = [.alert, .sound, .badge] UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: options) { (granted, error) in print(error as Any) }} The permission dialog is shown once, so make sure you accept it. It‚Äôs time to handle the device token. Open AppDelegate.swift, and add the following to the end of extension AppDelegate: 123456789func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) { // [1] Parse to token string let token = deviceToken.map { return String(format: \"%02.2hhx\", $0) }.joined() // [2] Log it print(\"Your device token is \\(token)\")} This is where you get device token if your app successfully connects to APNs. Normally, you would send this device token to the backend so they can organize , but in this tutorial we just log it. It is required in the tool to be able to target a particular device. Handling payloadOpen AppDelegate.swift and add the following to th end of extension AppDelegate: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any], fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -&gt; Void) { // [1] Always call the completion handler defer { completionHandler(.newData) } // [2] Convert into JSON dictionary guard let json = userInfo as? [String: Any] else { return } // [3] Parse to aps guard let aps = json[\"aps\"] as? [String: Any] else { return } // [4] Parse to urn guard let urn = aps[\"urn\"] as? String else { return } try? Navigator.navigate(urn: urn)} This method is called when your app receives push notification payload and is running. The above code is relatively straightforward: it first tries to parse the urn information from the payload, then tells Navigator to do the job . Build and run the app on the device, since push notifications won‚Äôt work on the simulator. Log in to the app if prompted. Once on the main screen, grant push notification permissions to the app in order to receive alerts. You should see the device token logged to your Xcode console. Testing Push NotificationsIn this tutorial, you‚Äôll use a tool called PushNotifications to help you easily create push notifications for your app. Download the tool PushNotifications from here. This tool sends payloads directly to APNs. Choose iOS\\Token to use Token Authentication, you get that by creating and downloading your Key from Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles. Browse for the .p8 auth key file that you downloaded earlier. Enter Team ID, you can check it by going to Membership Details Enter Key ID, this is the ID associated with the Key from the first step. Enter Bundle ID and device token. Paste the following into as. It is a traditional payload associated with the URN. 123456{ \"aps\":{ \"alert\":\"You become a celebrity on PhotoFeed, checkout your profile now\", \"urn\": \"user:self\" }} Since you‚Äôre debugging with Xcode, select Sandbox as environment. Tap Send now. If your app is in the background, an alert will appear. Tapping it will take you to your app and show you your user profile. Bravo! You just implemented deep linking in push notification, thanks again to the URL routing. Read moreHere is the final project with all the code from this tutorial. You now understand central routing patterns, have mastered Compass and even refactored a real-world app. However, there is no silver bullet that works well for all apps. You need to understand your requirements and adjust accordingly. If you want to learn more about other navigation patterns, here are a few suggestions: Coordinator Flow controller Routing in VIPER Remember, it‚Äôs not only about the code, but also about the user experience that your app provides.

That was to build a C library for voice over IP functionality for a very popular app, and that was how I got started in open source. The library I was working with were Linphone and pjsip. I learn a lot of UDP and SIP protocol, how to build C library for consumption in iOS, Android and Windows Phone, how challenging it is to support C++ component and thread pool in Windows Phone 8, how to tweak entropy functionality in OpenSSL to make it compile in Windows Phone 8, how hard it was to debug C code with Android NDK. It was time when I needed to open Visual Studio, Xcode and Eclipse IDE at the same time, joined mailing list and followed gmane. Lots of good memories. Today I find that those bookmarks I made are still available on Safari, so I think I should share here. I need to remove many articles because they are outdated or not available anymore. These are the resources that I actually read and used, not some random links. Hopefully you can find something useful. This post focuses more about resources for pjsip on client and how to talk directly and with/without a proxy server. First of allHere are some of the articles and open sources made by me regarding VoIP, hope you find it useful rtpproxy: I forked from http://www.rtpproxy.org/ and changed code to make it support for IP handover.

Usage To build an Xcode project, run xcodebuild from the directory containing your project (i.e. the directory containing the name.xcodeproj package). If you have multiple projects in the this directory you will need to use -project to indicate which project should be built. By default, xcodebuild builds the first target listed in the project, with the default build configu- ration. The order of the targets is a property of the project and is the same for all users of the project. To build an Xcode workspace, you must pass both the -workspace and -scheme options to define the build. The parameters of the scheme will control which targets are built and how they are built, although you may pass other options to xcodebuild to over- ride some parameters of the scheme. There are also several options that display info about the installed version of Xcode or about projects or workspaces in the local directory, but which do not initiate an action. These include -list, -showBuildSettings, -showdestinations, -showsdks, -showTestPlans, -usage, and -version. Options -project name.xcodeproj Build the project name.xcodeproj. Required if there are multiple project files in the same directory. -target targetname Build the target specified by targetname. -alltargets Build all the targets in the specified project. -workspace name.xcworkspace Build the workspace name.xcworkspace. -scheme schemename Build the scheme specified by schemename. Required if building a workspace. -destination destinationspecifier Use the destination device described by destinationspecifier. Defaults to a destination that is compatible with the selected scheme. See the Destinations section below for more details. -destination-timeout timeout Use the specified timeout when searching for a destination device. The default is 30 seconds. -configuration configurationname Use the build configuration specified by configurationname when building each target. -arch architecture Use the architecture specified by architecture when building each target. -sdk [sdkfullpath | sdkname] Build an Xcode project or workspace against the specified SDK, using build tools appropriate for that SDK. The argument may be an absolute path to an SDK, or the canonical name of an SDK. -showsdks Lists all available SDKs that Xcode knows about, including their canonical names suitable for use with -sdk. Does not initiate a build. -showBuildSettings Lists the build settings in a project or workspace and scheme. Does not initiate a build. Use with -project or -workspace and -scheme. -showdestinations Lists the valid destinations for a project or workspace and scheme. Does not initiate a build. Use with -project or -workspace and -scheme. -showBuildTimingSummary Display a report of the timings of all the commands invoked during the build. -showTestPlans Lists the test plans (if any) associated with the specified scheme. Does not initiate a build. Use with -scheme. -list Lists the targets and configurations in a project, or the schemes in a workspace. Does not initiate a build. Use with -project or -workspace. -enableAddressSanitizer [YES | NO] Turns the address sanitizer on or off. This overrides the setting for the launch action of a scheme in a workspace. -enableThreadSanitizer [YES | NO] Turns the thread sanitizer on or off. This overrides the setting for the launch action of a scheme in a workspace. -enableUndefinedBehaviorSanitizer [YES | NO] Turns the undefined behavior sanitizer on or off. This overrides the setting for the launch action of a scheme in a workspace. -enableCodeCoverage [YES | NO] Turns code coverage on or off during testing. This overrides the setting for the test action of a scheme in a workspace. -testLanguage language Specifies ISO 639-1 language during testing. This overrides the setting for the test action of a scheme in a workspace. -testRegion region Specifies ISO 3166-1 region during testing. This overrides the setting for the test action of a scheme in a workspace. -derivedDataPath path Overrides the folder that should be used for derived data when performing an action on a scheme in a workspace. -resultBundlePath path Writes a bundle to the specified path with results from performing an action on a scheme in a workspace. If the path already exists, xcodebuild will exit with an error. Intermediate directories will be created automatically. The bundle contains build logs, code coverage reports, XML property lists with test results, screenshots and other attachments col- lected during testing, and various diagnostic logs. -allowProvisioningUpdates Allow xcodebuild to communicate with the Apple Developer website. For automatically signed targets, xcodebuild will create and update profiles, app IDs, and certificates. For manually signed targets, xcodebuild will download missing or updated provisioning profiles. Requires a developer account to have been added in Xcode's Accounts preference pane. -allowProvisioningDeviceRegistration Allow xcodebuild to register your destination device on the Apple Developer website if necessary. Requires -allowProvisioningUpdates. -exportArchive Specifies that an archive should be distributed. Requires -archivePath and -exportOptionsPlist. For exporting, -exportPath is also required. Cannot be passed along with an action. -exportNotarizedApp Export an archive that has been notarized by Apple. Requires -archivePath and -exportPath. -archivePath xcarchivepath Specifies the path for the archive produced by the archive action, or specifies the archive that should be exported when -exportArchive or -exportNotarizedApp is passed. -exportPath destinationpath Specifies the destination for the exported product, including the name of the exported file. -exportOptionsPlist path Specifies options for -exportArchive. xcodebuild -help can print the full set of available options. -exportLocalizations Exports localizations to XLIFF files. Requires -project and -localizationPath. Cannot be passed along with an action. -importLocalizations Imports localizations from an XLIFF file. Requires -project and -localizationPath. Cannot be passed along with an action. -localizationPath Specifies a path to a directory or a single XLIFF localization file. -exportLanguage language Specifies optional ISO 639-1 languages included in a localization export. May be repeated to specify multiple languages. May be excluded to specify an export includes only development language strings. action ... Specify one or more actions to perform. Available actions are: build Build the target in the build root (SYMROOT). This is the default action, and is used if no action is given. build-for-testing Build the target and associated tests in the build root (SYMROOT). This will also produce an xctestrun file in the build root. This requires specifying a scheme. analyze Build and analyze a target or scheme from the build root (SYMROOT). This requires specifying a scheme. archive Archive a scheme from the build root (SYMROOT). This requires specifying a scheme. test Test a scheme from the build root (SYMROOT). This requires specifying a scheme and optionally a destination. test-without-building Test compiled bundles. If a scheme is provided with -scheme then the command finds bundles in the build root (SRCROOT). If an xctestrun file is provided with -xctestrun then the command finds bun- dles at paths specified in the xctestrun file. installsrc Copy the source of the project to the source root (SRCROOT). install Build the target and install it into the target's installation directory in the distribution root (DSTROOT). clean Remove build products and intermediate files from the build root (SYMROOT). -xcconfig filename Load the build settings defined in filename when building all targets. These settings will override all other settings, including settings passed individually on the command line. -xctestrun xctestrunpath Specifies test run parameters. Can only be used with the test-without-building action. Cannot be used with -workspace or -project. See &lt;x-man-page://5/xcodebuild.xctestrun&gt; for file format details. -testPlan test-plan-name Specifies which test plan associated with the scheme should be used for testing. Pass the name of the .xctestplan file without its extension. -skip-testing test-identifier, -only-testing test-identifier Constrain test targets, classes, or methods in test actions. -only-testing constrains a test action to only testing a specified identifier, and excluding all other identifiers. -skip-testing constrains a test action to skip testing a spec- ified identifier, but including all other identifiers. Test identifiers have the form TestTarget[/TestClass[/TestMethod]]. The TestTarget component of an identifier is the name of a unit or UI testing bundle as shown in the Test Navigator. An xcodebuild command can combine multiple constraint options, but -only-testing has precedence over -skip-testing. -skip-test-configuration test-configuration-name, -only-test-configuration test-configuration-name Constrain test configurations in test actions. -only-test-configuration constrains a test action to only test a specified test configuration within a test plan, and exclude all other test configurations. -skip-test-configuration constrains a test action to skip a specified test configuration, but include all other test configurations. Each test configuration name must match the name of a configuration specified in a test plan and is case-sensitive. An xcodebuild command can com- bine multiple constraint options, but -only-test-configuration has precedence over -skip-test-configuration. -disable-concurrent-destination-testing Do not run tests on the specified destinations concurrently. The full test suite will run to completion on a given desti- nation before it begins on the next. -maximum-concurrent-test-device-destinations number If multiple device destinations are specified (and -disable-concurrent-destination-testing is not passed), only test on number devices at a time. For example, if four iOS devices are specified, but number is 2, the full test suite will run on each device, but only two devices will be testing at a given time. -maximum-concurrent-test-simulator-destinations number If multiple simulator destinations are specified (and -disable-concurrent-destination-testing is not passed), only test on number simulators at a time. For example, if four iOS simulators are specified, but number is 2, the full test suite will run on each simulator, but only two simulators will be testing at a given time. -parallel-testing-enabled [YES | NO] Overrides the per-target setting in the scheme for running tests in parallel. -parallel-testing-worker-count number Spawn exactly number test runners when executing tests in parallel. Overrides -maximum-parallel-testing-workers, if it is specified. -maximum-parallel-testing-workers number Limit the number of test runners that will be spawned when running tests in parallel to number. -dry-run, -n Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them. -skipUnavailableActions Skip actions that cannot be performed instead of failing. This option is only honored if -scheme is passed. buildsetting=value Set the build setting buildsetting to value. A detailed reference of Xcode build settings can be found at: &lt;https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/itcaec37c2a6&gt; -userdefault=value Set the user default userdefault to value. -toolchain [identifier | name] Use a given toolchain, specified with either an identifier or name. -quiet Do not print any output except for warnings and errors. -verbose Provide additional status output. -version Display version information for this install of Xcode. Does not initiate a build. When used in conjunction with -sdk, the version of the specified SDK is displayed, or all SDKs if -sdk is given no argument. Additionally, a single line of the reported version information may be returned if infoitem is specified. -license Show the Xcode and SDK license agreements. Allows for accepting the license agreements without launching Xcode itself, which is useful for headless systems. Must be run as a privileged user. -checkFirstLaunchStatus Check if any First Launch tasks need to be performed. -runFirstLaunch Install packages and agree to the license. -usage Displays usage information for xcodebuild. Destinations The -destination option takes as its argument a destination specifier describing the device (or devices) to use as a destina- tion. A destination specifier is a single argument consisting of a set of comma-separated key=value pairs. The -destination option may be specified multiple times to cause xcodebuild to perform the specified action on multiple destinations. Destination specifiers may include the platform key to specify one of the supported destination platforms. There are additional keys which should be supplied depending on the platform of the device you are selecting. Some devices may take time to look up. The -destination-timeout option can be used to specify the amount of time to wait before a device is considered unavailable. If unspecified, the default timeout is 30 seconds. Currently, xcodebuild supports these platforms: macOS The local Mac, referred to in the Xcode interface as My Mac, and which supports the following key: arch The architecture to use, either x86_64 (the default) or i386. variant The optional variant to use, e.g. Mac Catalyst. iOS An iOS device, which supports the following keys: id The identifier of the device to use, as shown in the Devices window. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. name The name of the device to use. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. iOS Simulator A simulated iOS device, which supports the following keys: id The identifier of the simulated device to use, as shown in the Devices window. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. name The name of the simulated device to use. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. OS When specifying the simulated device by name, the iOS version for that simulated device, such as 6.0, or the string latest (the default) to indicate the most recent version of iOS supported by this version of Xcode. watchOS A watchOS app is always built and deployed nested inside of an iOS app. To use a watchOS device as your des- tination, specify a scheme which is configured to run a WatchKit app, and specify the iOS platform destina- tion that is paired with the watchOS device you want to use. watchOS Simulator A watchOS Simulator app is always built and deployed nested inside of an iOS Simulator app. To use a watchOS Simulator device as your destination, specify a scheme which is configured to run a WatchKit app, and specify the iOS Simulator platform destination that is paired with the watchOS Simulator device you want to use. tvOS A tvOS device, which supports the following keys: id The identifier of the device to use, as shown in the Devices window. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. name The name of the device to use. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. tvOS Simulator A simulated tvOS device, which supports the following keys: id The identifier of the simulated device to use, as shown in the Devices window. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. name The name of the simulated device to use. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. OS When specifying the simulated device by name, the tvOS version for that simulated device, such as 9.0, or the string latest (the default) to indicate the most recent version of tvOS supported by this ver- sion of Xcode. Some actions (such as building) may be performed without an actual device present. To build against a platform generically instead of a specific device, the destination specifier may be prefixed with the optional string &quot;generic/&quot;, indicating that the platform should be targeted generically. An example of a generic destination is the &quot;Generic iOS Device&quot; destination displayed in Xcode's UI when no physical iOS device is present. Testing on Multiple Destinations When more than one destination is specified with the -destination option, xcodebuild tests on those destinations concurrently. In this mode, xcodebuild automatically chooses the number of devices and simulators that are used simultaneously. All enabled tests in the scheme or xctestrun file are run on each destination. Distributing Archives The -exportArchive option specifies that xcodebuild should distribute the archive specified by -archivePath using the options specified by -exportOptionsPlist. xcodebuild -help can print the full set of available inputs to -exportOptionsPlist. The product can either be uploaded to Apple or exported locally. The exported product will be placed at the path specified by -exportPath. Archives that have been uploaded to the Apple notary service can be distributed using the -exportNotarizedApp option. This spec- ifies that xcodebuild should export a notarized app from the archive specified by -archivePath and place the exported product at the path specified by -exportPath. If the archive has not completed processing by the notary service, or processing failed, then xcodebuild will exit and emit informational or error messages. When uploading an archive using the -exportArchive option, or exporting a notarized archive using the -exportNotarizedApp option, an Apple ID account belonging to the archive's development team is required. Enter the credentials for the Apple ID account using Xcode's Accounts preference pane before invoking xcodebuild. Environment Variables The following environment variables affect the execution of xcodebuild: XCODE_XCCONFIG_FILE Set to a path to a file, build settings in that file will be loaded and used when building all targets. These settings will override all other settings, including settings passed individually on the command line, and those in the file passed with the -xcconfig option. Exit Codes xcodebuild exits with codes defined by sysexits(3). It will exit with EX_OK on success. On failure, it will commonly exit with EX_USAGE if any options appear malformed, EX_NOINPUT if any input files cannot be found, EX_IOERR if any files cannot be read or written, and EX_SOFTWARE if the commands given to xcodebuild fail. It may exit with other codes in less common scenarios.EXAMPLES xcodebuild clean install Cleans the build directory; then builds and installs the first target in the Xcode project in the directory from which xcodebuild was started. xcodebuild -project MyProject.xcodeproj -target Target1 -target Target2 -configuration Debug Builds the targets Target1 and Target2 in the project MyProject.xcodeproj using the Debug configuration. xcodebuild -target MyTarget OBJROOT=/Build/MyProj/Obj.root SYMROOT=/Build/MyProj/Sym.root Builds the target MyTarget in the Xcode project in the directory from which xcodebuild was started, putting intermedi- ate files in the directory /Build/MyProj/Obj.root and the products of the build in the directory /Build/MyProj/Sym.root. xcodebuild -sdk macosx10.6 Builds the Xcode project in the directory from which xcodebuild was started against the macOS 10.6 SDK. The canonical names of all available SDKs can be viewed using the -showsdks option. xcodebuild -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme Builds the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace. xcodebuild archive -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme Archives the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace. xcodebuild build-for-testing -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme -destination generic/platform=iOS Build tests and associated targets in the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace using the generic iOS device destination. The command also writes test parameters from the scheme to an xctestrun file in the built products directory. xcodebuild test-without-building -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 5s' -destination 'platform=iOS,name=My iPad' Tests the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace using both the iOS Simulator and the device named iPhone 5s for the latest version of iOS. The command assumes the test bundles are in the build root (SYMROOT).

Usage To build an Xcode project, run xcodebuild from the directory containing your project (i.e. the directory containing the name.xcodeproj package). If you have multiple projects in the this directory you will need to use -project to indicate which project should be built. By default, xcodebuild builds the first target listed in the project, with the default build configu- ration. The order of the targets is a property of the project and is the same for all users of the project. To build an Xcode workspace, you must pass both the -workspace and -scheme options to define the build. The parameters of the scheme will control which targets are built and how they are built, although you may pass other options to xcodebuild to over- ride some parameters of the scheme. There are also several options that display info about the installed version of Xcode or about projects or workspaces in the local directory, but which do not initiate an action. These include -list, -showBuildSettings, -showdestinations, -showsdks, -showTestPlans, -usage, and -version. Options -project name.xcodeproj Build the project name.xcodeproj. Required if there are multiple project files in the same directory. -target targetname Build the target specified by targetname. -alltargets Build all the targets in the specified project. -workspace name.xcworkspace Build the workspace name.xcworkspace. -scheme schemename Build the scheme specified by schemename. Required if building a workspace. -destination destinationspecifier Use the destination device described by destinationspecifier. Defaults to a destination that is compatible with the selected scheme. See the Destinations section below for more details. -destination-timeout timeout Use the specified timeout when searching for a destination device. The default is 30 seconds. -configuration configurationname Use the build configuration specified by configurationname when building each target. -arch architecture Use the architecture specified by architecture when building each target. -sdk [sdkfullpath | sdkname] Build an Xcode project or workspace against the specified SDK, using build tools appropriate for that SDK. The argument may be an absolute path to an SDK, or the canonical name of an SDK. -showsdks Lists all available SDKs that Xcode knows about, including their canonical names suitable for use with -sdk. Does not initiate a build. -showBuildSettings Lists the build settings in a project or workspace and scheme. Does not initiate a build. Use with -project or -workspace and -scheme. -showdestinations Lists the valid destinations for a project or workspace and scheme. Does not initiate a build. Use with -project or -workspace and -scheme. -showBuildTimingSummary Display a report of the timings of all the commands invoked during the build. -showTestPlans Lists the test plans (if any) associated with the specified scheme. Does not initiate a build. Use with -scheme. -list Lists the targets and configurations in a project, or the schemes in a workspace. Does not initiate a build. Use with -project or -workspace. -enableAddressSanitizer [YES | NO] Turns the address sanitizer on or off. This overrides the setting for the launch action of a scheme in a workspace. -enableThreadSanitizer [YES | NO] Turns the thread sanitizer on or off. This overrides the setting for the launch action of a scheme in a workspace. -enableUndefinedBehaviorSanitizer [YES | NO] Turns the undefined behavior sanitizer on or off. This overrides the setting for the launch action of a scheme in a workspace. -enableCodeCoverage [YES | NO] Turns code coverage on or off during testing. This overrides the setting for the test action of a scheme in a workspace. -testLanguage language Specifies ISO 639-1 language during testing. This overrides the setting for the test action of a scheme in a workspace. -testRegion region Specifies ISO 3166-1 region during testing. This overrides the setting for the test action of a scheme in a workspace. -derivedDataPath path Overrides the folder that should be used for derived data when performing an action on a scheme in a workspace. -resultBundlePath path Writes a bundle to the specified path with results from performing an action on a scheme in a workspace. If the path already exists, xcodebuild will exit with an error. Intermediate directories will be created automatically. The bundle contains build logs, code coverage reports, XML property lists with test results, screenshots and other attachments col- lected during testing, and various diagnostic logs. -allowProvisioningUpdates Allow xcodebuild to communicate with the Apple Developer website. For automatically signed targets, xcodebuild will create and update profiles, app IDs, and certificates. For manually signed targets, xcodebuild will download missing or updated provisioning profiles. Requires a developer account to have been added in Xcode's Accounts preference pane. -allowProvisioningDeviceRegistration Allow xcodebuild to register your destination device on the Apple Developer website if necessary. Requires -allowProvisioningUpdates. -exportArchive Specifies that an archive should be distributed. Requires -archivePath and -exportOptionsPlist. For exporting, -exportPath is also required. Cannot be passed along with an action. -exportNotarizedApp Export an archive that has been notarized by Apple. Requires -archivePath and -exportPath. -archivePath xcarchivepath Specifies the path for the archive produced by the archive action, or specifies the archive that should be exported when -exportArchive or -exportNotarizedApp is passed. -exportPath destinationpath Specifies the destination for the exported product, including the name of the exported file. -exportOptionsPlist path Specifies options for -exportArchive. xcodebuild -help can print the full set of available options. -exportLocalizations Exports localizations to XLIFF files. Requires -project and -localizationPath. Cannot be passed along with an action. -importLocalizations Imports localizations from an XLIFF file. Requires -project and -localizationPath. Cannot be passed along with an action. -localizationPath Specifies a path to a directory or a single XLIFF localization file. -exportLanguage language Specifies optional ISO 639-1 languages included in a localization export. May be repeated to specify multiple languages. May be excluded to specify an export includes only development language strings. action ... Specify one or more actions to perform. Available actions are: build Build the target in the build root (SYMROOT). This is the default action, and is used if no action is given. build-for-testing Build the target and associated tests in the build root (SYMROOT). This will also produce an xctestrun file in the build root. This requires specifying a scheme. analyze Build and analyze a target or scheme from the build root (SYMROOT). This requires specifying a scheme. archive Archive a scheme from the build root (SYMROOT). This requires specifying a scheme. test Test a scheme from the build root (SYMROOT). This requires specifying a scheme and optionally a destination. test-without-building Test compiled bundles. If a scheme is provided with -scheme then the command finds bundles in the build root (SRCROOT). If an xctestrun file is provided with -xctestrun then the command finds bun- dles at paths specified in the xctestrun file. installsrc Copy the source of the project to the source root (SRCROOT). install Build the target and install it into the target's installation directory in the distribution root (DSTROOT). clean Remove build products and intermediate files from the build root (SYMROOT). -xcconfig filename Load the build settings defined in filename when building all targets. These settings will override all other settings, including settings passed individually on the command line. -xctestrun xctestrunpath Specifies test run parameters. Can only be used with the test-without-building action. Cannot be used with -workspace or -project. See &lt;x-man-page://5/xcodebuild.xctestrun&gt; for file format details. -testPlan test-plan-name Specifies which test plan associated with the scheme should be used for testing. Pass the name of the .xctestplan file without its extension. -skip-testing test-identifier, -only-testing test-identifier Constrain test targets, classes, or methods in test actions. -only-testing constrains a test action to only testing a specified identifier, and excluding all other identifiers. -skip-testing constrains a test action to skip testing a spec- ified identifier, but including all other identifiers. Test identifiers have the form TestTarget[/TestClass[/TestMethod]]. The TestTarget component of an identifier is the name of a unit or UI testing bundle as shown in the Test Navigator. An xcodebuild command can combine multiple constraint options, but -only-testing has precedence over -skip-testing. -skip-test-configuration test-configuration-name, -only-test-configuration test-configuration-name Constrain test configurations in test actions. -only-test-configuration constrains a test action to only test a specified test configuration within a test plan, and exclude all other test configurations. -skip-test-configuration constrains a test action to skip a specified test configuration, but include all other test configurations. Each test configuration name must match the name of a configuration specified in a test plan and is case-sensitive. An xcodebuild command can com- bine multiple constraint options, but -only-test-configuration has precedence over -skip-test-configuration. -disable-concurrent-destination-testing Do not run tests on the specified destinations concurrently. The full test suite will run to completion on a given desti- nation before it begins on the next. -maximum-concurrent-test-device-destinations number If multiple device destinations are specified (and -disable-concurrent-destination-testing is not passed), only test on number devices at a time. For example, if four iOS devices are specified, but number is 2, the full test suite will run on each device, but only two devices will be testing at a given time. -maximum-concurrent-test-simulator-destinations number If multiple simulator destinations are specified (and -disable-concurrent-destination-testing is not passed), only test on number simulators at a time. For example, if four iOS simulators are specified, but number is 2, the full test suite will run on each simulator, but only two simulators will be testing at a given time. -parallel-testing-enabled [YES | NO] Overrides the per-target setting in the scheme for running tests in parallel. -parallel-testing-worker-count number Spawn exactly number test runners when executing tests in parallel. Overrides -maximum-parallel-testing-workers, if it is specified. -maximum-parallel-testing-workers number Limit the number of test runners that will be spawned when running tests in parallel to number. -dry-run, -n Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them. -skipUnavailableActions Skip actions that cannot be performed instead of failing. This option is only honored if -scheme is passed. buildsetting=value Set the build setting buildsetting to value. A detailed reference of Xcode build settings can be found at: &lt;https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/itcaec37c2a6&gt; -userdefault=value Set the user default userdefault to value. -toolchain [identifier | name] Use a given toolchain, specified with either an identifier or name. -quiet Do not print any output except for warnings and errors. -verbose Provide additional status output. -version Display version information for this install of Xcode. Does not initiate a build. When used in conjunction with -sdk, the version of the specified SDK is displayed, or all SDKs if -sdk is given no argument. Additionally, a single line of the reported version information may be returned if infoitem is specified. -license Show the Xcode and SDK license agreements. Allows for accepting the license agreements without launching Xcode itself, which is useful for headless systems. Must be run as a privileged user. -checkFirstLaunchStatus Check if any First Launch tasks need to be performed. -runFirstLaunch Install packages and agree to the license. -usage Displays usage information for xcodebuild. Destinations The -destination option takes as its argument a destination specifier describing the device (or devices) to use as a destina- tion. A destination specifier is a single argument consisting of a set of comma-separated key=value pairs. The -destination option may be specified multiple times to cause xcodebuild to perform the specified action on multiple destinations. Destination specifiers may include the platform key to specify one of the supported destination platforms. There are additional keys which should be supplied depending on the platform of the device you are selecting. Some devices may take time to look up. The -destination-timeout option can be used to specify the amount of time to wait before a device is considered unavailable. If unspecified, the default timeout is 30 seconds. Currently, xcodebuild supports these platforms: macOS The local Mac, referred to in the Xcode interface as My Mac, and which supports the following key: arch The architecture to use, either x86_64 (the default) or i386. variant The optional variant to use, e.g. Mac Catalyst. iOS An iOS device, which supports the following keys: id The identifier of the device to use, as shown in the Devices window. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. name The name of the device to use. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. iOS Simulator A simulated iOS device, which supports the following keys: id The identifier of the simulated device to use, as shown in the Devices window. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. name The name of the simulated device to use. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. OS When specifying the simulated device by name, the iOS version for that simulated device, such as 6.0, or the string latest (the default) to indicate the most recent version of iOS supported by this version of Xcode. watchOS A watchOS app is always built and deployed nested inside of an iOS app. To use a watchOS device as your des- tination, specify a scheme which is configured to run a WatchKit app, and specify the iOS platform destina- tion that is paired with the watchOS device you want to use. watchOS Simulator A watchOS Simulator app is always built and deployed nested inside of an iOS Simulator app. To use a watchOS Simulator device as your destination, specify a scheme which is configured to run a WatchKit app, and specify the iOS Simulator platform destination that is paired with the watchOS Simulator device you want to use. tvOS A tvOS device, which supports the following keys: id The identifier of the device to use, as shown in the Devices window. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. name The name of the device to use. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. tvOS Simulator A simulated tvOS device, which supports the following keys: id The identifier of the simulated device to use, as shown in the Devices window. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. name The name of the simulated device to use. A valid destination specifier must provide either id or name, but not both. OS When specifying the simulated device by name, the tvOS version for that simulated device, such as 9.0, or the string latest (the default) to indicate the most recent version of tvOS supported by this ver- sion of Xcode. Some actions (such as building) may be performed without an actual device present. To build against a platform generically instead of a specific device, the destination specifier may be prefixed with the optional string &quot;generic/&quot;, indicating that the platform should be targeted generically. An example of a generic destination is the &quot;Generic iOS Device&quot; destination displayed in Xcode's UI when no physical iOS device is present. Testing on Multiple Destinations When more than one destination is specified with the -destination option, xcodebuild tests on those destinations concurrently. In this mode, xcodebuild automatically chooses the number of devices and simulators that are used simultaneously. All enabled tests in the scheme or xctestrun file are run on each destination. Distributing Archives The -exportArchive option specifies that xcodebuild should distribute the archive specified by -archivePath using the options specified by -exportOptionsPlist. xcodebuild -help can print the full set of available inputs to -exportOptionsPlist. The product can either be uploaded to Apple or exported locally. The exported product will be placed at the path specified by -exportPath. Archives that have been uploaded to the Apple notary service can be distributed using the -exportNotarizedApp option. This spec- ifies that xcodebuild should export a notarized app from the archive specified by -archivePath and place the exported product at the path specified by -exportPath. If the archive has not completed processing by the notary service, or processing failed, then xcodebuild will exit and emit informational or error messages. When uploading an archive using the -exportArchive option, or exporting a notarized archive using the -exportNotarizedApp option, an Apple ID account belonging to the archive's development team is required. Enter the credentials for the Apple ID account using Xcode's Accounts preference pane before invoking xcodebuild. Environment Variables The following environment variables affect the execution of xcodebuild: XCODE_XCCONFIG_FILE Set to a path to a file, build settings in that file will be loaded and used when building all targets. These settings will override all other settings, including settings passed individually on the command line, and those in the file passed with the -xcconfig option. Exit Codes xcodebuild exits with codes defined by sysexits(3). It will exit with EX_OK on success. On failure, it will commonly exit with EX_USAGE if any options appear malformed, EX_NOINPUT if any input files cannot be found, EX_IOERR if any files cannot be read or written, and EX_SOFTWARE if the commands given to xcodebuild fail. It may exit with other codes in less common scenarios.EXAMPLES xcodebuild clean install Cleans the build directory; then builds and installs the first target in the Xcode project in the directory from which xcodebuild was started. xcodebuild -project MyProject.xcodeproj -target Target1 -target Target2 -configuration Debug Builds the targets Target1 and Target2 in the project MyProject.xcodeproj using the Debug configuration. xcodebuild -target MyTarget OBJROOT=/Build/MyProj/Obj.root SYMROOT=/Build/MyProj/Sym.root Builds the target MyTarget in the Xcode project in the directory from which xcodebuild was started, putting intermedi- ate files in the directory /Build/MyProj/Obj.root and the products of the build in the directory /Build/MyProj/Sym.root. xcodebuild -sdk macosx10.6 Builds the Xcode project in the directory from which xcodebuild was started against the macOS 10.6 SDK.

The available options vary based on the selected distribution method. Defaults to export. embedOnDemandResourcesAssetPacksInBundle : Bool For non-App Store exports, if the app uses On Demand Resources and this is YES, asset packs are embedded in the app bundle so that the app can be tested without a server to host asset packs. Defaults to YES unless onDemandResourcesAssetPacksBaseURL is specified. generateAppStoreInformation : Bool For App Store exports, should Xcode generate App Store Information for uploading with iTMSTransporter? Defaults to NO. iCloudContainerEnvironment : String If the app is using CloudKit, this configures the &quot;com.apple.developer.icloud-container-environment&quot; entitlement. Available options vary depending on the type of provisioning profile used, but may include: Development and Production. installerSigningCertificate : String For manual signing only. Provide a certificate name, SHA-1 hash, or automatic selector to use for signing. Automatic selectors allow Xcode to pick the newest installed certificate of a particular type. The available automatic selectors are &quot;Mac Installer Distribution&quot; and &quot;Developer ID Installer&quot;. Defaults to an automatic certificate selector matching the current distribution method. manifest : Dictionary For non-App Store exports, users can download your app over the web by opening your distribution manifest file in a web browser. To generate a distribution manifest, the value of this key should be a dictionary with three sub-keys: appURL, displayImageURL, fullSizeImageURL. The additional sub-key assetPackManifestURL is required when using on-demand resources. method : String Describes how Xcode should export the archive. Available options: app-store, validation, ad-hoc, package, enterprise, development, developer-id, and mac-application. The list of options varies based on the type of archive. Defaults to development. onDemandResourcesAssetPacksBaseURL : String For non-App Store exports, if the app uses On Demand Resources and embedOnDemandResourcesAssetPacksInBundle isn't YES, this should be a base URL specifying where asset packs are going to be hosted. This configures the app to download asset packs from the specified URL. provisioningProfiles : Dictionary For manual signing only. Specify the provisioning profile to use for each executable in your app. Keys in this dictionary are the bundle identifiers of executables; values are the provisioning profile name or UUID to use. signingCertificate : String For manual signing only. Provide a certificate name, SHA-1 hash, or automatic selector to use for signing. Automatic selectors allow Xcode to pick the newest installed certificate of a particular type. The available automatic selectors are &quot;Mac App Distribution&quot;, &quot;iOS Developer&quot;, &quot;iOS Distribution&quot;, &quot;Developer ID Application&quot;, &quot;Apple Distribution&quot;, &quot;Mac Developer&quot;, and &quot;Apple Development&quot;. Defaults to an automatic certificate selector matching the current distribution method. signingStyle : String The signing style to use when re-signing the app for distribution. Options are manual or automatic. Apps that were automatically signed when archived can be signed manually or automatically during distribution, and default to automatic. Apps that were manually signed when archived must be manually signed during distribtion, so the value of signingStyle is ignored. stripSwiftSymbols : Bool Should symbols be stripped from Swift libraries in your IPA? Defaults to YES. teamID : String The Developer Portal team to use for this export. Defaults to the team used to build the archive. thinning : String For non-App Store exports, should Xcode thin the package for one or more device variants? Available options: &lt;none&gt; (Xcode produces a non-thinned universal app), &lt;thin-for-all-variants&gt; (Xcode produces a universal app and all available thinned variants), or a model identifier for a specific device (e.g. &quot;iPhone7,1&quot;).
